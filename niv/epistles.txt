Romans 



1 



Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, 

called to be an apostle and set apart for 
the gospel of God- 

2 the gospel he promised beforehand 
through his prophets in the Holy 
Scriptures 

Regarding his Son, who as to his human 
nature was a descendant of David, 

4 and who through the Spirit of holiness 
was declared with power to be the Son 
of God by his resurrection from the 
dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. 

5 Through him and for his name's sake, 
we received grace and apostleship to 
call people from among all the Gentiles 
to the obedience that comes from faith. 

6 And you also are among those who are 
called to belong to Jesus Christ. 

7 To all in Rome who are loved by God 
and called to be saints: Grace and 
peace to you from God our Father and 
from the Lord Jesus Christ. 

8 First, I thank my God through Jesus 
Christ for all of you, because your faith 
is being reported all over the world. 

9 God, whom I serve with my whole heart 
in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my 
witness how constantly I remember you 



10 in my prayers at all times; and I pray 
that now at last by God's will the way 
may be opened for me to come to you. 

11 1 long to see you so that I may impart 
to you some spiritual gift to make you 
strong- 

12 that is, that you and I may be mutually 
encouraged by each other's faith. 

13 l do not want you to be unaware, 
brothers, that I planned many times to 
come to you (but have been prevented 
from doing so until now) in order that I 
might have a harvest among you, just as 
I have had among the other Gentiles. 

14 l am obligated both to Greeks and 
non-Greeks, both to the wise and the 
foolish. 

15 That is why I am so eager to preach 
the gospel also to you who are at Rome. 

16 l am not ashamed of the gospel, 
because it is the power of God for the 
salvation of everyone who believes: first 
for the Jew, then for the Gentile. 

17 For in the gospel a righteousness from 
God is revealed, a righteousness that is 
by faith from first to last, just as it is 
written: "The righteous will live by faith." 

18 The wrath of God is being revealed 
from heaven against all the godlessness 
and wickedness of men who suppress 
the truth by their wickedness, 



19 since what may be known about God 
is plain to them, because God has made 
it plain to them. 

20 For since the creation of the world 
God's invisible qualitiesâ€” his eternal 
power and divine nature-have been 
clearly seen, being understood from 
what has been made, so that men are 
without excuse. 

21 For although they knew God, they 
neither glorified him as God nor gave 
thanks to him, but their thinking became 
futile and their foolish hearts were 
darkened. 

22 Although they claimed to be wise, they 
became fools 

23 and exchanged the glory of the 
immortal God for images made to look 
like mortal man and birds and animals 
and reptiles. 

24 Therefore God gave them over in the 
sinful desires of their hearts to sexual 
impurity for the degrading of their bodies 
with one another. 



another. Men committed indecent acts 
with other men, and received in 
themselves the due penalty for their 
perversion. 

28 Furthermore, since they did not think it 
worthwhile to retain the knowledge of 
God, he gave them over to a depraved 
mind, to do what ought not to be done. 

29 They have become filled with every 
kind of wickedness, evil, greed and 
depravity. They are full of envy, murder, 
strife, deceit and malice. They are 
gossips, 

30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, 
arrogant and boastful; they invent ways 
of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 

31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, 
ruthless. 

32 Although they know God's righteous 
decree that those who do such things 
deserve death, they not only continue to 
do these very things but also approve of 
those who practice them. 



25 They exchanged the truth of God for a 
lie, and worshiped and served created 
things rather than the Creator-who is 
forever praised. Amen. 

26 Because of this, God gave them over 
to shameful lusts. Even their women 
exchanged natural relations for 
unnatural ones. 

27 ln the same way the men also 
abandoned natural relations with women 
and were inflamed with lust for one 



fcYou, therefore, have no excuse, you 

who pass judgment on someone else, 
for at whatever point you judge the other, 
you are condemning yourself, because 
you who pass judgment do the same 
things. 

2 Now we know that God's judgment 
against those who do such things is 
based on truth. 

3 So when you, a mere man, pass 
judgment on them and yet do the same 



things, do you think you wil 
God's judgment? 



escape those who obey the law who will 
declared righteous. 



be 



4 Or do you show contempt for the riches 
of his kindness, tolerance and patience, 
not realizing that God's kindness leads 
you toward repentance? 

5 But because of your stubbornness and 
your unrepentant heart, you are storing 
up wrath against yourself for the day of 
God's wrath, when his righteous 
judgment will be revealed. 

6 God "will give to each person according 
to what he has done." 

7 To those who by persistence in doing 
good seek glory, honor and immortality, 
he will give eternal life. 

8 But for those who are self-seeking and 
who reject the truth and follow evil, there 
will be wrath and anger. 

9 There will be trouble and distress for 
every human being who does evil: first 
for the Jew, then for the Gentile; 

10 but glory, honor and peace for 
everyone who does good: first for the 
Jew, then for the Gentile. 

11 For God does not show favoritism. 



(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not 
have the law, do by nature things 
required by the law, they are a law for 
themselves, even though they do not 
have the law, 

15 since they show that the requirements 
of the law are written on their hearts, 
their consciences also bearing witness, 
and their thoughts now accusing, now 
even defending them.) 

16 This will take place on the day when 
God will judge men's secrets through 
Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares. 

17 Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if 
you rely on the law and brag about your 
relationship to God; 

18 if you know his will and approve of 
what is superior because you are 
instructed by the law; 

19 if you are convinced that you are a 
guide for the blind, a light for those who 
are in the dark, 

20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher 
of infants, because you have in the law 
the embodiment of knowledge and truth- 



12 



All who sin apart from the law will also 
perish apart from the law, and all who 
sin under the law will be judged by the 
law. 



you, then, who teach others, do you 
not teach yourself? You who preach 
against stealing, do you steal? 



13 For it is not those who hear the law 
who are righteous in God's sight, but it is 



You who say that people should not 
commit adultery, do you commit 



adultery? You who abhor idols, do you 
rob temples? 

23 You who brag about the law, do you 
dishonor God by breaking the law? 

24 As it is written: "God's name is 
blasphemed among the Gentiles 
because of you." 

25 Circumcision has value if you observe 
the law, but if you break the law, you 
have become as though you had not 
been circumcised. 

26 lf those who are not circumcised keep 
the law's requirements, will they not be 
regarded as though they were 
circumcised? 

27 The one who is not circumcised 
physically and yet obeys the law will 
condemn you who, even though you 
have the written code and circumcision, 
are a lawbreaker. 

28 A man is not a Jew if he is only one 
outwardly, nor is circumcision merely 
outward and physical. 

29 No, a man is a Jew if he is one 
inwardly; and circumcision is 
circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, 
not by the written code. Such a man's 
praise is not from men, but from God. 



Owhat advantage, then, is there in 

being a Jew, or what value is there in 
circumcision? 



Much in every way! First of all, they 
have been entrusted with the very words 
of God. 

3 What if some did not have faith? Will 
their lack of faith nullify God's 
faithfulness? 

4 Not at all! Let God be true, and every 
man a liar. As it is written: "So that you 
may be proved right when you speak 
and prevail when you judge." 

5 But if our unrighteousness brings out 
God's righteousness more clearly, what 
shall we say? That God is unjust in 
bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a 
human argument.) 

6 Certainly not! If that were so, how could 
God judge the world? 

7 Someone might argue, "If my falsehood 
enhances God's truthfulness and so 
increases his glory, why am I still 
condemned as a sinner?" 

8 Why not say-as we are being 
slanderously reported as saying and as 
some claim that we say-"Let us do evil 
that good may result"? Their 
condemnation is deserved. 

9 What shall we conclude then? Are we 
any better ? Not at all! We have already 
made the charge that Jews and Gentiles 
alike are all under sin. 

10 As it is written: "There is no one 
righteous, not even one; 

11 there is no one who understands, no 
one who seeks God. 



12 AII have turned away, they have 
together become worthless; there is no 
one who does good, not even one." 

13 "Their throats are open graves; their 
tongues practice deceit." "The poison of 
vipers is on their lips." 

14 "Their mouths are full of cursing and 
bitterness." 

15 "Their feet are swift to shed blood; 

16 ruin and misery mark their ways, 

17 and the way of peace they do not 
know." 

18 "There is no fear of God before their 
eyes." 

19 Now we know that whatever the law 
says, it says to those who are under the 
law, so that every mouth may be 
silenced and the whole world held 
accountable to God. 

20 Therefore no one will be declared 
righteous in his sight by observing the 
law; rather, through the law we become 
conscious of sin. 

21 But now a righteousness from God, 
apart from law, has been made known, 
to which the Law and the Prophets 
testify. 

22 This righteousness from God comes 
through faith in Jesus Christ to all who 
believe. There is no difference, 

23 for all have sinned and fall short of the 
glory of God, 



and are justified freely by his grace 
through the redemption that came by 
Christ Jesus. 

25 God presented him as a sacrifice of 
atonement, through faith in his blood. 
He did this to demonstrate his justice, 
because in his forbearance he had left 
the sins committed beforehand 
unpunished- 

26 he did it to demonstrate his justice at 
the present time, so as to be just and 
the one who justifies those who have 
faith in Jesus. 

27 Where, then, is boasting? It is 
excluded. On what principle? On that of 
observing the law? No, but on that of 
faith. 

28 For we maintain that a man is justified 
by faith apart from observing the law. 

29 ls God the God of Jews only? Is he not 
the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of 
Gentiles too, 

30 since there is only one God, who will 
justify the circumcised by faith and the 
uncircumcised through that same faith. 

31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this 
faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the 
law. 



tWhat then shall we say that Abraham, 
our forefather, discovered in this matter? 

2 lf, in fact, Abraham was justified by 
works, he had something to boast 
about-but not before God. 



What does the Scripture say? 
"Abraham believed God, and it was 
credited to him as righteousness." 

4 Now when a man works, his wages are 
not credited to him as a gift, but as an 
obligation. 

5 However, to the man who does not 

work but trusts God who justifies the 

wicked, his faith is credited as 
righteousness. 

6 David says the same thing when he 
speaks of the blessedness of the man to 
whom God credits righteousness apart 
from works: 

7 "Blessed are they whose 
transgressions are forgiven, whose sins 
are covered. 

8 Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord 
will never count against him." 

9 ls this blessedness only for the 
circumcised, or also for the 
uncircumcised? We have been saying 
that Abraham's faith was credited to him 
as righteousness. 

10 Under what circumstances was it 
credited? Was it after he was 
circumcised, or before? It was not after, 
but before! 

11 And he received the sign of 
circumcision, a seal of the 
righteousness that he had by faith while 
he was still uncircumcised. So then, he 
is the father of all who believe but have 
not been circumcised, in order that 
righteousness might be credited to them. 



And he is also the father of the 
circumcised who not only are 
circumcised but who also walk in the 
footsteps of the faith that our father 
Abraham had before he was 
circumcised. 

13 lt was not through law that Abraham 
and his offspring received the promise 
that he would be heir of the world, but 
through the righteousness that comes 
by faith. 

14 For if those who live by law are heirs, 
faith has no value and the promise is 
worthless, 

15 because law brings wrath. And where 
there is no law there is no transgression. 

16 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, 
so that it may be by grace and may be 
guaranteed to all Abraham's offspringâ€” 
not only to those who are of the law but 
also to those who are of the faith of 
Abraham. He is the father of us all. 

17 As it is written: "I have made you a 
father of many nations." He is our father 
in the sight of God, in whom he 
believed-the God who gives life to the 
dead and calls things that are not as 
though they were. 

18 Against all hope, Abraham in hope 
believed and so became the father of 
many nations, just as it had been said to 
him, "So shall your offspring be." 

19 Without weakening in his faith, he 
faced the fact that his body was as good 
as dead-since he was about a hundred 



years old-and that Sarah's womb was 
also dead. 

20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief 
regarding the promise of God, but was 
strengthened in his faith and gave glory 
to God, 

21 being fully persuaded that God had 
power to do what he had promised. 

22 This is why "it was credited to him as 
righteousness." 

23 The words "it was credited to him" 
were written not for him alone, 



And hope does not disappoint us, 
because God has poured out his love 
into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom 
he has given us. 

6 You see, at just the right time, when we 
were still powerless, Christ died for the 
ungodly. 

7 Very rarely will anyone die for a 
righteous man, though for a good man 
someone might possibly dare to die. 

8 But God demonstrates his own love for 
us in this: While we were still sinners, 
Christ died for us. 



24 but also for us, to whom God will credit 
righteousness-for us who believe in him 
who raised Jesus our Lord from the 
dead. 

25 He was delivered over to death for our 
sins and was raised to life for our 
justification. 



Since we have now been justified by 
his blood, how much more shall we be 
saved from God's wrath through him! 

10 For if, when we were God's enemies, 
we were reconciled to him through the 
death of his Son, how much more, 
having been reconciled, shall we be 
saved through his life! 



^Therefore, since we have been 

justified through faith, we have peace 
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

through whom we have gained access 
by faith into this grace in which we now 
stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the 
glory of God. 

3 Not only so, but we also rejoice in our 
sufferings, because we know that 
suffering produces perseverance; 

4 perseverance, character; and character, 
hope. 



Not only is this so, but we also rejoice 
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
through whom we have now received 
reconciliation. 

12 Therefore, just as sin entered the 
world through one man, and death 
through sin, and in this way death came 
to all men, because all sinned- 

13 for before the law was given, sin was 
in the world. But sin is not taken into 
account when there is no law. 

^Nevertheless, death reigned from the 
time of Adam to the time of Moses, even 



over those who did not sin by breaking a 
command, as did Adam, who was a 
pattern of the one to come. 

15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For 
if the many died by the trespass of the 
one man, how much more did God's 
grace and the gift that came by the 
grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, 
overflow to the many! 

16 Again, the gift of God is not like the 
result of the one man's sin: The 
judgment followed one sin and brought 
condemnation, but the gift followed 
many trespasses and brought 
justification. 

17 For if, by the trespass of the one man, 
death reigned through that one man, 
how much more will those who receive 
God's abundant provision of grace and 
of the gift of righteousness reign in life 
through the one man, Jesus Christ. 

^Consequently, just as the result of one 
trespass was condemnation for all men, 
so also the result of one act of 
righteousness was justification that 
brings life for all men. 

19 For just as through the disobedience 
of the one man the many were made 
sinners, so also through the obedience 
of the one man the many will be made 
righteous. 

20 The law was added so that the 
trespass might increase. But where sin 
increased, grace increased all the more, 



righteousness to bring eternal life 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. 



WWhat shall we say, then? Shall we go 
on sinning so that grace may increase? 

2 By no means! We died to sin; how can 
we live in it any longer? 

3 Or don't you know that all of us who 
were baptized into Christ Jesus were 
baptized into his death? 

4 We were therefore buried with him 
through baptism into death in order that, 
just as Christ was raised from the dead 
through the glory of the Father, we too 
may live a new life. 

5 lf we have been united with him like this 
in his death, we will certainly also be 
united with him in his resurrection. 

6 For we know that our old self was 
crucified with him so that the body of sin 
might be done away with, that we 
should no longer be slaves to sin- 

7 because anyone who has died has 
been freed from sin. 

8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe 
that we will also live with him. 

9 For we know that since Christ was 
raised from the dead, he cannot die 
again; death no longer has mastery over 
him. 



21 



so that, just as sin reigned in death, so 
also grace might reign through 



The death he died, he died to sin once 
for all; but the life he lives, he lives to 
God. 

11 ln the same way, count yourselves 
dead to sin but alive to God in Christ 
Jesus. 

12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your 
mortal body so that you obey its evil 
desires. 



I put this in human terms because you 
are weak in your natural selves. Just as 
you used to offer the parts of your body 
in slavery to impurity and to ever- 
increasing wickedness, so now offer 
them in slavery to righteousness leading 
to holiness. 

20 When you were slaves to sin, you 
were free from the control of 
righteousness. 



Do not offer the parts of your body to 
sin, as instruments of wickedness, but 
rather offer yourselves to God, as those 
who have been brought from death to 
life; and offer the parts of your body to 
him as instruments of righteousness. 

14 For sin shall not be your master, 
because you are not under law, but 
under grace. 

15 What then? Shall we sin because we 
are not under law but under grace? By 
no means! 

16 Don't you know that when you offer 
yourselves to someone to obey him as 
slaves, you are slaves to the one whom 
you obey-whether you are slaves to sin, 
which leads to death, or to obedience, 
which leads to righteousness? 

17 But thanks be to God that, though you 
used to be slaves to sin, you 
wholeheartedly obeyed the form of 
teaching to which you were entrusted. 

18 You have been set free from sin and 
have become slaves to righteousness. 



21 What benefit did you reap at that time 
from the things you are now ashamed 
of? Those things result in death! 

22 But now that you have been set free 
from sin and have become slaves to 
God, the benefit you reap leads to 
holiness, and the result is eternal life. 

23 For the wages of sin is death, but the 
gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus 
our Lord. 



f Do you not know, brothers-for I am 

speaking to men who know the law-that 
the law has authority over a man only as 
long as he lives? 

2 For example, by law a married woman 
is bound to her husband as long as he is 
alive, but if her husband dies, she is 
released from the law of marriage. 

3 So then, if she marries another man 
while her husband is still alive, she is 
called an adulteress. But if her husband 
dies, she is released from that law and 
is not an adulteress, even though she 
marries another man. 



4 So, my brothers, you also died to the 
law through the body of Christ, that you 
might belong to another, to him who was 
raised from the dead, in order that we 
might bear fruit to God. 

5 For when we were controlled by the 
sinful nature, the sinful passions 
aroused by the law were at work in our 
bodies, so that we bore fruit for death. 

6 But now, by dying to what once bound 
us, we have been released from the law 
so that we serve in the new way of the 
Spirit, and not in the old way of the 
written code. 

7 What shall we say, then? Is the law 
sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not 
have known what sin was except 
through the law. For I would not have 
known what coveting really was if the 
law had not said, "Do not covet." 

8 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded 
by the commandment, produced in me 
every kind of covetous desire. For apart 
from law, sin is dead. 

9 Once I was alive apart from law; but 
when the commandment came, sin 
sprang to life and I died. 

10 l found that the very commandment 
that was intended to bring life actually 
brought death. 

"For sin, seizing the opportunity 
afforded by the commandment, 
deceived me, and through the 
commandment put me to death. 



12 So then, the law is holy, and the 
commandment is holy, righteous and 
good. 

13 Did that which is good, then, become 
death to me? By no means! But in order 
that sin might be recognized as sin, it 
produced death in me through what was 
good, so that through the 
commandment sin might become utterly 
sinful. 

14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I 
am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 

15 l do not understand what I do. For 
what I want to do I do not do, but what I 
hate I do. 

16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I 
agree that the law is good. 

17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do 
it, but it is sin living in me. 

18 l know that nothing good lives in me, 
that is, in my sinful nature. For I have 
the desire to do what is good, but I 
cannot carry it out. 

19 For what I do is not the good I want to 
do; no, the evil I do not want to do-this I 
keep on doing. 

20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it 
is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living 
in me that does it. 

21 So I find this law at work: When I want 
to do good, evil is right there with me. 

22 For in my inner being I delight in God's 
law; 



but I see another law at work in the 
members of my body, waging war 
against the law of my mind and making 
me a prisoner of the law of sin at work 
within my members. 

24 What a wretched man I am! Who will 
rescue me from this body of death? 

25 Thanks be to God-through Jesus 
Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my 
mind am a slave to God's law, but in the 
sinful nature a slave to the law of sin. 



8 



â–ºTherefore, there is now no 
condemnation for those who are in 
Christ Jesus, 

2 because through Christ Jesus the law 
of the Spirit of life set me free from the 
law of sin and death. 

3 For what the law was powerless to do 
in that it was weakened by the sinful 
nature, God did by sending his own Son 
in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin 
offering. And so he condemned sin in 
sinful man, 



6 The mind of sinful man is death, but the 
mind controlled by the Spirit is life and 
peace; 

7 the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does 
not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. 

8 Those controlled by the sinful nature 
cannot please God. 

9 You, however, are controlled not by the 
sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit 
of God lives in you. And if anyone does 
not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not 
belong to Christ. 

10 But if Christ is in you, your body is 
dead because of sin, yet your spirit is 
alive because of righteousness. 

11 And if the Spirit of him who raised 
Jesus from the dead is living in you, he 
who raised Christ from the dead will also 
give life to your mortal bodies through 
his Spirit, who lives in you. 

12 Therefore, brothers, we have an 
obligationâ€” but it is not to the sinful 
nature, to live according to it. 



4 in order that the righteous requirements 
of the law might be fully met in us, who 
do not live according to the sinful nature 
but according to the Spirit. 

5 Those who live according to the sinful 
nature have their minds set on what that 
nature desires; but those who live in 
accordance with the Spirit have their 
minds set on what the Spirit desires. 



For if you live according to the sinful 
nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit 
you put to death the misdeeds of the 
body, you will live, 

"because those who are led by the 
Spirit of God are sons of God. 

15 For you did not receive a spirit that 
makes you a slave again to fear, but you 
received the Spirit of sonship. And by 
him we cry, "Abba, Father." 



16 The Spirit himself testifies with our 
spirit that we are God's children. 

17 Now if we are children, then we are 
heirs-heirs of God and co-heirs with 
Christ, if indeed we share in his 
sufferings in order that we may also 
share in his glory. 

18 l consider that our present sufferings 
are not worth comparing with the glory 
that will be revealed in us. 

19 The creation waits in eager 
expectation for the sons of God to be 
revealed. 

20 For the creation was subjected to 
frustration, not by its own choice, but by 



the will 
hope 



of the one who subjected it, in 



that the creation itself will be liberated 
from its bondage to decay and brought 
into the glorious freedom of the children 
of God. 

22 We know that the whole creation has 
been groaning as in the pains of 
childbirth right up to the present time. 

23 Not only so, but we ourselves, who 
have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan 
inwardly as we wait eagerly for our 
adoption as sons, the redemption of our 
bodies. 

24 For in this hope we were saved. But 
hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who 
hopes for what he already has? 

25 But if we hope for what we do not yet 
have, we wait for it patiently. 



In the same way, the Spirit helps us in 
our weakness. We do not know what we 
ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself 
intercedes for us with groans that words 
cannot express. 

27 And he who searches our hearts 
knows the mind of the Spirit, because 
the Spirit intercedes for the saints in 
accordance with God's will. 

28 And we know that in all things God 
works for the good of those who love 
him, who have been called according to 
his purpose. 

29 For those God foreknew he also 
predestined to be conformed to the 
likeness of his Son, that he might be the 
firstborn among many brothers. 

30 And those he predestined, he also 
called; those he called, he also justified; 
those he justified, he also glorified. 

31 What, then, shall we say in response 
to this? If God is for us, who can be 
against us? 

32 He who did not spare his own Son, but 
gave him up for us all-how will he not 
also, along with him, graciously give us 
all things? 

33 Who will bring any charge against 
those whom God has chosen? It is God 
who justifies. 

34 Who is he that condemns? Christ 
Jesus, who died-more than that, who 
was raised to life-is at the right hand of 
God and is also interceding for us. 



Who shall separate us from the love of 
Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or 
persecution or famine or nakedness or 
danger or sword? 

36 As it is written: "For your sake we face 
death all day long; we are considered as 
sheep to be slaughtered." 

37 No, in all these things we are more 
than conquerors through him who loved 
us. 

38 For I am convinced that neither death 
nor life, neither angels nor demons, 
neither the present nor the future, nor 
any powers, 

39 neither height nor depth, nor anything 
else in all creation, will be able to 
separate us from the love of God that is 
in Christ Jesus our Lord. 



Â«/l speak the truth in Christ-I am not 

lying, my conscience confirms it in the 
Holy Spiritâ€” 

2 I have great sorrow and unceasing 
anguish in my heart. 

3 For I could wish that I myself were 
cursed and cut off from Christ for the 
sake of my brothers, those of my own 
race, 

4 the people of Israel. Theirs is the 
adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, 
the covenants, the receiving of the law, 
the temple worship and the promises. 

5 Theirs are the patriarchs, and from 
them is traced the human ancestry of 



Christ, who is 
praised! Amen. 



God over all, forever 



It is not as though God's word had 
failed. For not all who are descended 
from Israel are Israel. 

7 Nor because they are his descendants 
are they all Abraham's children. On the 
contrary, "It is through Isaac that your 
offspring will be reckoned." 

8 ln other words, it is not the natural 
children who are God's children, but it is 
the children of the promise who are 
regarded as Abraham's offspring. 

9 For this was how the promise was 
stated: "At the appointed time I will 
return, and Sarah will have a son." 

10 Not only that, but Rebekah's children 
had one and the same father, our father 
Isaac. 

11 Yet, before the twins were born or had 
done anything good or bad-in order that 
God's purpose in election might stand: 

12 not by works but by him who calls-she 
was told, "The older will serve the 
younger." 



Just as it is written: 
Esau I hated." 



"Jacob I loved, but 



14 What then shall we say? Is God 
unjust? Not at all! 

15 For he says to Moses, "I will have 
mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will 
have compassion on whom I have 
compassion." 



It does not, therefore, depend on 
man's desire or effort, but on God's 
mercy. 

17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I 
raised you up for this very purpose, that 
I might display my power in you and that 
my name might be proclaimed in all the 
earth." 



25 As he says in Hosea: "I will call them 
'my people' who are not my people; and 
I will call her 'my loved one' who is not 
my loved one," 

26 and, "It will happen that in the very 
place where it was said to them, 'You 
are not my people,' they will be called 
'sons of the living God.' " 



Therefore God has mercy on whom he 
wants to have mercy, and he hardens 
whom he wants to harden. 

19 One of you will say to me: "Then why 
does God still blame us? For who 
resists his will?" 



Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: 
"Though the number of the Israelites be 
like the sand by the sea, only the 
remnant will be saved. 

28 For the Lord will carry out his sentence 
on earth with speed and finality." 



But who are you, O man, to talk back 
to God? "Shall what is formed say to 
him who formed it, 'Why did you make 
me like this?' " 

21 Does not the potter have the right to 
make out of the same lump of clay some 
pottery for noble purposes and some for 
common use? 

22 What if God, choosing to show his 
wrath and make his power known, bore 
with great patience the objects of his 
wrath-prepared for destruction? 

23 What if he did this to make the riches 
of his glory known to the objects of his 
mercy, whom he prepared in advance 
for gloryâ€” 

24 even us, whom he also called, not only 
from the Jews but also from the 
Gentiles? 



It is just as Isaiah said previously: 
"Unless the Lord Almighty had left us 
descendants, we would have become 
like Sodom, we would have been like 
Gomorrah." 

30 What then shall we say? That the 
Gentiles, who did not pursue 
righteousness, have obtained it, a 
righteousness that is by faith; 

31 but Israel, who pursued a law of 
righteousness, has not attained it. 

32 Why not? Because they pursued it not 
by faith but as if it were by works. They 
stumbled over the "stumbling stone." 

33 As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a 
stone that causes men to stumble and a 
rock that makes them fall, and the one 
who trusts in him will never be put to 
shame." 



m 



'Brothers, my heart's desire and 

prayer to God for the Israelites is that 
they may be saved. 

2 For I can testify about them that they 
are zealous for God, but their zeal is not 
based on knowledge. 

3 Since they did not know the 
righteousness that comes from God and 
sought to establish their own, they did 
not submit to God's righteousness. 

4 Christ is the end of the law so that there 
may be righteousness for everyone who 
believes. 

5 Moses describes in this way the 
righteousness that is by the law: "The 
man who does these things will live by 
them." 

6 But the righteousness that is by faith 
says: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who 
will ascend into heaven?' " (that is, to 
bring Christ down) 

7 "or 'Who will descend into the deep?' " 
(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 

8 But what does it say? "The word is near 
you; it is in your mouth and in your 
heart," that is, the word of faith we are 
proclaiming: 

9 That if you confess with your mouth, 
"Jesus is Lord," and believe in your 
heart that God raised him from the dead, 
you will be saved. 

10 For it is with your heart that you 
believe and are justified, and it is with 



your mouth that you confess and are 
saved. 

11 As the Scripture says, "Anyone who 
trusts in him will never be put to shame." 

12 For there is no difference between Jew 
and Gentile-the same Lord is Lord of all 
and richly blesses all who call on him, 

13 for, "Everyone who calls on the name 
of the Lord will be saved." 

14 How, then, can they call on the one 
they have not believed in? And how can 
they believe in the one of whom they 
have not heard? And how can they hear 
without someone preaching to them? 

15 And how can they preach unless they 
are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful 
are the feet of those who bring good 
news!" 

16 But not all the Israelites accepted the 
good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who 
has believed our message?" 

17 Consequently, faith comes from 
hearing the message, and the message 
is heard through the word of Christ. 

18 But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course 
they did: "Their voice has gone out into 
all the earth, their words to the ends of 
the world." 

19 Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? 
First, Moses says, "I will make you 
envious by those who are not a nation; I 
will make you angry by a nation that has 
no understanding." 



And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found 
by those who did not seek me; I 
revealed myself to those who did not 
ask for me." 

21 But concerning Israel he says, "All day 
long I have held out my hands to a 
disobedient and obstinate people." 



11 



I ask then: Did God reject his 

people? By no means! I am an Israelite 
myself, a descendant of Abraham, from 
the tribe of Benjamin. 

2 God did not reject his people, whom he 
foreknew. Don't you know what the 
Scripture says in the passage about 
Elijah-how he appealed to God against 
Israel: 

3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets 
and torn down your altars; I am the only 
one left, and they are trying to kill me" ? 

4 And what was God's answer to him? "I 
have reserved for myself seven 
thousand who have not bowed the knee 
to Baal." 



see and ears so that they could not hear, 
to this very day." 

9 And David says: "May their table 
become a snare and a trap, a stumbling 
block and a retribution for them. 

10 May their eyes be darkened so they 
cannot see, and their backs be bent 
forever." 

11 Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to 
fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, 
because of their transgression, salvation 
has come to the Gentiles to make Israel 
envious. 

12 But if their transgression means riches 
for the world, and their loss means 
riches for the Gentiles, how much 
greater riches will their fullness bring! 

13 l am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch 
as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I 
make much of my ministry 

14 in the hope that I may somehow 
arouse my own people to envy and save 
some of them. 



So too, at the present time there is a 
remnant chosen by grace. 

6 And if by grace, then it is no longer by 
works; if it were, grace would no longer 
be grace. 

7 What then? What Israel sought so 
earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect 
did. The others were hardened, 

8 as it is written: "God gave them a spirit 
of stupor, eyes so that they could not 



For if their rejection is the 
reconciliation of the world, what will their 
acceptance be but life from the dead? 

16 lf the part of the dough offered as 
firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is 
holy; if the root is holy, so are the 
branches. 

17 lf some of the branches have been 
broken off, and you, though a wild olive 
shoot, have been grafted in among the 



others and now share in the nourishing 
sap from the olive root, 

18 do not boast over those branches. If 
you do, consider this: You do not 
support the root, but the root supports 
you. 

19 You will say then, "Branches were 
broken off so that I could be grafted in." 



Zion; he will 
from Jacob. 



turn godlessness away 



And this is my covenant with them 
when I take away their sins." 

28 As far as the gospel is concerned, they 
are enemies on your account; but as far 
as election is concerned, they are loved 
on account of the patriarchs, 



Granted. But they were broken off 
because of unbelief, and you stand by 
faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 

21 For if God did not spare the natural 
branches, he will not spare you either. 



for God's gifts and his call are 
irrevocable. 

30 Just as you who were at one time 
disobedient to God have now received 
mercy as a result of their disobedience, 



Consider therefore the kindness and 
sternness of God: sternness to those 
who fell, but kindness to you, provided 
that you continue in his kindness. 
Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 

23 And if they do not persist in unbelief, 
they will be grafted in, for God is able to 
graft them in again. 

24 After all, if you were cut out of an olive 
tree that is wild by nature, and contrary 
to nature were grafted into a cultivated 
olive tree, how much more readily will 
these, the natural branches, be grafted 
into their own olive tree! 



so they too have now become 
disobedient in order that they too may 
now receive mercy as a result of God's 
mercy to you. 

32 For God has bound all men over to 
disobedience so that he may have 
mercy on them all. 

33 0h, the depth of the riches of the 
wisdom and knowledge of God! How 
unsearchable his judgments, and his 
paths beyond tracing out! 

34 "Who has known the mind of the Lord? 
Or who has been his counselor?" 



I do not want you to be ignorant of this 
mystery, brothers, so that you may not 
be conceited: Israel has experienced a 
hardening in part until the full number of 
the Gentiles has come in. 

26 And so all Israel will be saved, as it is 
written: "The deliverer will come from 



35 "Who has ever given to God, that God 
should repay him?" 

36 For from him and through him and to 
him are all things. To him be the glory 
forever! Amen. 



12 



â– Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in 

view of God's mercy, to offer your 
bodies as living sacrifices, holy and 
pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act 
of worship. 

2 Do not conform any longer to the 
pattern of this world, but be transformed 
by the renewing of your mind. Then you 
will be able to test and approve what 
God's will isâ€” his good, pleasing and 
perfect will. 

3 For by the grace given me I say to 
every one of you: Do not think of 
yourself more highly than you ought, but 
rather think of yourself with sober 
judgment, in accordance with the 
measure of faith God has given you. 

4 Just as each of us has one body with 
many members, and these members do 
not all have the same function, 

5 so in Christ we who are many form one 
body, and each member belongs to all 
the others. 

6 We have different gifts, according to the 
grace given us. If a man's gift is 
prophesying, let him use it in proportion 
to his faith. 

7 lf it is serving, let him serve; if it is 
teaching, let him teach; 

8 if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if 
it is contributing to the needs of others, 
let him give generously; if it is leadership, 
let him govern diligently; if it is showing 
mercy, let him do it cheerfully. 



Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; 
cling to what is good. 

10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly 
love. Honor one another above 
yourselves. 

"Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your 
spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 

12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, 
faithful in prayer. 

13 Share with God's people who are in 
need. Practice hospitality. 

14 Bless those who persecute you; bless 
and do not curse. 

15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn 
with those who mourn. 



16 Live in harmony with one another. Do 
not be proud, but be willing to associate 
with people of low position. Do not be 
conceited. 

17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be 
careful to do what is right in the eyes of 
everybody. 

18 lf it is possible, as far as it depends on 
you, live at peace with everyone. 

19 Do not take revenge, my friends, but 
leave room for God's wrath, for it is 
written: "It is mine to avenge; I will 
repay," says the Lord. 

20 On the contrary: "If your enemy is 
hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give 
him something to drink. In doing this, 



you will heap burning coals on his 
head." 

21 Do not be overcome by evil, but 
overcome evil with good. 



13, 



â€¢ Everyone must submit himself to 

the governing authorities, for there is no 
authority except that which God has 
established. The authorities that exist 
have been established by God. 

Consequently, he who rebels against 
the authority is rebelling against what 
God has instituted, and those who do so 
will bring judgment on themselves. 

3 For rulers hold no terror for those who 
do right, but for those who do wrong. Do 
you want to be free from fear of the one 
in authority? Then do what is right and 
he will commend you. 

4 For he is God's servant to do you good. 
But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he 
does not bear the sword for nothing. He 
is God's servant, an agent of wrath to 
bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 

therefore, it is necessary to submit to 
the authorities, not only because of 
possible punishment but also because 
of conscience. 

6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the 
authorities are God's servants, who give 
their full time to governing. 

7 Give everyone what you owe him: If 
you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, 
then revenue; if respect, then respect; if 
honor, then honor. 



Let no debt remain outstanding, except 
the continuing debt to love one another, 
for he who loves his fellowman has 
fulfilled the law. 

9 The commandments, "Do not commit 
adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not 
steal," "Do not covet," and whatever 
other commandment there may be, are 
summed up in this one rule: "Love your 
neighbor as yourself." 

10 Love does no harm to its neighbor. 
Therefore love is the fulfillment of the 
law. 

"And do this, understanding the present 
time. The hour has come for you to 
wake up from your slumber, because 
our salvation is nearer now than when 
we first believed. 

12 The night is nearly over; the day is 
almost here. So let us put aside the 
deeds of darkness and put on the armor 
of light. 

13 Let us behave decently, as in the 
daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, 
not in sexual immorality and debauchery, 
not in dissension and jealousy. 

14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think 
about how to gratify the desires of the 
sinful nature. 



14 



PAccept him whose faith is weak, 

without passing judgment on disputable 
matters. 



One man's faith allows him to eat 
everything, but another man, whose 
faith is weak, eats only vegetables. 



It is written: " 'As surely as I live,' says 
the Lord, 'every knee will bow before 
me; every tongue will confess to God.' " 



The man who eats everything must not 
look down on him who does not, and the 
man who does not eat everything must 
not condemn the man who does, for 
God has accepted him. 

4 Who are you to judge someone else's 
servant? To his own master he stands 
or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is 
able to make him stand. 

5 One man considers one day more 
sacred than another; another man 
considers every day alike. Each one 
should be fully convinced in his own 
mind. 

6 He who regards one day as special, 
does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, 
eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to 
God; and he who abstains, does so to 
the Lord and gives thanks to God. 

7 For none of us lives to himself alone 
and none of us dies to himself alone. 

8 lf we live, we live to the Lord; and if we 
die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we 
live or die, we belong to the Lord. 

9 For this very reason, Christ died and 
returned to life so that he might be the 
Lord of both the dead and the living. 



So then, each of us will give an 
account of himself to God. 

13 Therefore let us stop passing 
judgment on one another. Instead, make 
up your mind not to put any stumbling 
block or obstacle in your brother's way. 

14 As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am 
fully convinced that no food is unclean in 
itself. But if anyone regards something 
as unclean, then for him it is unclean. 

15 lf your brother is distressed because of 
what you eat, you are no longer acting 
in love. Do not by your eating destroy 
your brother for whom Christ died. 

16 Do not allow what you consider good 
to be spoken of as evil. 

17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter 
of eating and drinking, but of 
righteousness, peace and joy in the 
Holy Spirit, 

18 because anyone who serves Christ in 
this way is pleasing to God and 
approved by men. 

19 Let us therefore make every effort to 
do what leads to peace and to mutual 
edification. 



You, then, why do you judge your 
brother? Or why do you look down on 
your brother? For we will all stand 
before God's judgment seat. 



Do not destroy the work of God for the 
sake of food. All food is clean, but it is 
wrong for a man to eat anything that 
causes someone else to stumble. 



It is better not to eat meat or drink 
wine or to do anything else that will 
cause your brother to fall. 



7 Accept one another, then, just as Christ 
accepted you, in order to bring praise to 
God. 



So whatever you believe about these 
things keep between yourself and God. 
Blessed is the man who does not 
condemn himself by what he approves. 



For I tell you that Christ has become a 
servant of the Jews on behalf of God's 
truth, to confirm the promises made to 
the patriarchs 



But the man who has doubts is 
condemned if he eats, because his 
eating is not from faith; and everything 
that does not come from faith is sin. 



9 so that the Gentiles may glorify God for 
his mercy, as it is written: "Therefore I 
will praise you among the Gentiles; I will 
sing hymns to your name." 



15* 



'We who are strong ought to bear 

with the failings of the weak and not to 
please ourselves. 

2 Each of us should please his neighbor 
for his good, to build him up. 

3 For even Christ did not please himself 
but, as it is written: "The insults of those 
who insult you have fallen on me." 

4 For everything that was written in the 
past was written to teach us, so that 
through endurance and the 
encouragement of the Scriptures we 
might have hope. 

5 May the God who gives endurance and 
encouragement give you a spirit of unity 
among yourselves as you follow Christ 
Jesus, 

6 so that with one heart and mouth you 
may glorify the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ. 



10 Again, it says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, 
with his people." 

11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all you 
Gentiles, and sing praises to him, all you 
peoples." 

12 And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of 
Jesse will spring up, one who will arise 
to rule over the nations; the Gentiles will 
hope in him." 

13 May the God of hope fill you with all 
joy and peace as you trust in him, so 
that you may overflow with hope by the 
power of the Holy Spirit. 

14 l myself am convinced, my brothers, 
that you yourselves are full of goodness, 
complete in knowledge and competent 
to instruct one another. 

15 l have written you quite boldly on 
some points, as if to remind you of them 
again, because of the grace God gave 
me 

16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the 
Gentiles with the priestly duty of 



proclaiming the gospel of God, so that 
the Gentiles might become an offering 
acceptable to God, sanctified by the 
Holy Spirit. 

17 Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my 
service to God. 



Now, however, I am on my way to 
Jerusalem in the service of the saints 
there. 

26 For Macedonia and Achaia were 
pleased to make a contribution for the 
poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 



I will not venture to speak of anything 
except what Christ has accomplished 
through me in leading the Gentiles to 
obey God by what I have said and done- 



They were pleased to do it, and indeed 
they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles 
have shared in the Jews' spiritual 
blessings, they owe it to the Jews to 
share with them their material blessings. 



by the power of signs and miracles, 
through the power of the Spirit. So from 
Jerusalem all the way around to 
lllyricum, I have fully proclaimed the 
gospel of Christ. 

20 lt has always been my ambition to 
preach the gospel where Christ was not 
known, so that I would not be building 
on someone else's foundation. 

21 Rather, as it is written: "Those who 
were not told about him will see, and 
those who have not heard will 
understand." 

22 This is why I have often been hindered 
from coming to you. 



28 So after I have completed this task 
and have made sure that they have 
received this fruit, I will go to Spain and 
visit you on the way. 

29 l know that when I come to you, I will 
come in the full measure of the blessing 
of Christ. 

30 l urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus 
Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to 
join me in my struggle by praying to God 
for me. 

31 Pray that I may be rescued from the 
unbelievers in Judea and that my 
service in Jerusalem may be acceptable 
to the saints there, 



But now that there is no more place for 
me to work in these regions, and since I 
have been longing for many years to 
see you, 

24 l plan to do so when I go to Spain. I 
hope to visit you while passing through 
and to have you assist me on my 
journey there, after I have enjoyed your 
company for awhile. 



so that by God's will I may come to 
you with joy and together with you be 
refreshed. 

33 The God of peace be with you all. 
Amen. 



16, 



M commend to you our sister 

Phoebe, a servant of the church in 
Cenchrea. 

2 I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a 
way worthy of the saints and to give her 
any help she may need from you, for 
she has been a great help to many 
people, including me. 

3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow 
workers in Christ Jesus. 

4 They risked their lives for me. Not only I 
but all the churches of the Gentiles are 
grateful to them. 

5 Greet also the church that meets at 
their house. Greet my dear friend 
Epenetus, who was the first convert to 
Christ in the province of Asia. 

6 Greet Mary, who worked very hard for 
you. 

7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my 
relatives who have been in prison with 
me. They are outstanding among the 
apostles, and they were in Christ before 
I was. 

8 Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the 
Lord. 

9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in 
Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. 

10 Greet Apelles, tested and approved in 
Christ. Greet those who belong to the 
household of Aristobulus. 



"Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet 
those in the household of Narcissus who 
are in the Lord. 

12 Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those 
women who work hard in the Lord. 
Greet my dear friend Persis, another 
woman who has worked very hard in the 
Lord. 

13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and 
his mother, who has been a mother to 
me, too. 

14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, 
Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with 
them. 

15 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and 
his sister, and Olympas and all the 
saints with them. 

16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All 
the churches of Christ send greetings. 

17 l urge you, brothers, to watch out for 
those who cause divisions and put 
obstacles in your way that are contrary 
to the teaching you have learned. Keep 
away from them. 

18 For such people are not serving our 
Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By 
smooth talk and flattery they deceive the 
minds of naive people. 

19 Everyone has heard about your 
obedience, so I am full of joy over you; 
but I want you to be wise about what is 
good, and innocent about what is evil. 



20 The God of peace will soon crush 
Satan under your feet. The grace of our 
Lord Jesus be with you. 

21 Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his 
greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason 
and Sosipater, my relatives. 

22 l, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, 
greet you in the Lord. 

23 Gaius, whose hospitality I and the 
whole church here enjoy, sends you his 
greetings. Erastus, who is the city's 
director of public works, and our brother 
Quartus send you their greetings. 



Now to him who is able to establish 
you by my gospel and the proclamation 
of Jesus Christ, according to the 
revelation of the mystery hidden for long 
ages past, 

26 but now revealed and made known 
through the prophetic writings by the 
command of the eternal God, so that all 
nations might believe and obey him- 

27 to the only wise God be glory forever 
through Jesus Christ! Amen. 



1st Corinthians 



1 



Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ 

Jesus by the will of God, and our brother 
Sosthenes, 

2 To the church of God in Corinth, to 
those sanctified in Christ Jesus and 
called to be holy, together with all those 
everywhere who call on the name of our 
Lord Jesus Christâ€” their Lord and ours: 

3 Grace and peace to you from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

4 I always thank God for you because of 
his grace given you in Christ Jesus. 

5 For in him you have been enriched in 
every way-in all your speaking and in 
all your knowledge- 

6 because our testimony about Christ 
was confirmed in you. 

therefore you do not lack any spiritual 
gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord 
Jesus Christ to be revealed. 

8 He will keep you strong to the end, so 
that you will be blameless on the day of 
our Lord Jesus Christ. 

9 God, who has called you into fellowship 
with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is 
faithful. 

10 l appeal to you, brothers, in the name 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you 



agree with one another so that there 
may be no divisions among you and that 
you may be perfectly united in mind and 
thought. 

11 My brothers, some from Chloe's 
household have informed me that there 
are quarrels among you. 

12 What I mean is this: One of you says, 
"I follow Paul"; another, "I follow 
Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas "; still 
another, "I follow Christ." 

13 ls Christ divided? Was Paul crucified 
for you? Were you baptized into the 
name of Paul? 

14 l am thankful that I did not baptize any 
of you except Crispus and Gaius, 

15 so no one can say that you were 
baptized into my name. 

16 (Yes, I also baptized the household of 
Stephanas; beyond that, I don't 
remember if I baptized anyone else.) 

17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, 
but to preach the gospel-not with words 
of human wisdom, lest the cross of 
Christ be emptied of its power. 

18 For the message of the cross is 
foolishness to those who are perishing, 
but to us who are being saved it is the 
power of God. 



For it is written: "I will destroy the 
wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of 
the intelligent I will frustrate." 

20 Where is the wise man? Where is the 
scholar? Where is the philosopher of 
this age? Has not God made foolish the 
wisdom of the world? 

21 For since in the wisdom of God the 
world through its wisdom did not know 
him, God was pleased through the 
foolishness of what was preached to 
save those who believe. 



28 He chose the lowly things of this world 
and the despised things-and the things 
that are not-to nullify the things that are, 



29 so that no one may boast before him. 

30 lt is because of him that you are in 
Christ Jesus, who has become for us 
wisdom from God-that is, our 
righteousness, holiness and redemption. 



Therefore, as it is written: 
boasts boast in the Lord." 



'Let him who 



Jews demand miraculous signs and 
Greeks look for wisdom, 

23 but we preach Christ crucified: a 
stumbling block to Jews and foolishness 
to Gentiles, 

24 but to those whom God has called, 
both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power 
of God and the wisdom of God. 

25 For the foolishness of God is wiser 
than man's wisdom, and the weakness 
of God is stronger than man's strength. 

26 Brothers, think of what you were when 
you were called. Not many of you were 
wise by human standards; not many 
were influential; not many were of noble 
birth. 

27 But God chose the foolish things of the 
world to shame the wise; God chose the 
weak things of the world to shame the 
strong. 



fcWhen I came to you, brothers, I did 

not come with eloquence or superior 
wisdom as I proclaimed to you the 
testimony about God. 

2 For I resolved to know nothing while I 
was with you except Jesus Christ and 
him crucified. 

3 I came to you in weakness and fear, 
and with much trembling. 

4 My message and my preaching were 
not with wise and persuasive words, but 
with a demonstration of the Spirit's 
power, 

5 so that your faith might not rest on 
men's wisdom, but on God's power. 

6 We do, however, speak a message of 
wisdom among the mature, but not the 
wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this 
age, who are coming to nothing. 

7 No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, 
a wisdom that has been hidden and that 



God destined for our glory before time 
began. 

8 None of the rulers of this age 
understood it, for if they had, they would 
not have crucified the Lord of glory. 

9 However, as it is written: "No eye has 
seen, no ear has heard, no mind has 
conceived what God has prepared for 
those who love him" -- 

10 but God has revealed it to us by his 
Spirit. 

11 The Spirit searches all things, even the 
deep things of God. For who among 
men knows the thoughts of a man 
except the man's spirit within him? In the 
same way no one knows the thoughts of 
God except the Spirit of God. 

12 We have not received the spirit of the 
world but the Spirit who is from God, 
that we may understand what God has 
freely given us. 

13 This is what we speak, not in words 
taught us by human wisdom but in 
words taught by the Spirit, expressing 
spiritual truths in spiritual words. 

14 The man without the Spirit does not 
accept the things that come from the 
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to 
him, and he cannot understand them, 
because they are spiritually discerned. 

15 The spiritual man makes judgments 
about all things, but he himself is not 
subject to any man's judgment: 



16 "For who has known the mind of the 
Lord that he may instruct him?" But we 
have the mind of Christ. 



O Brothers, I could not address you as 

spiritual but as worldly-mere infants in 
Christ. 

2 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you 
were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are 
still not ready. 

3 You are still worldly. For since there is 
jealousy and quarreling among you, are 
you not worldly? Are you not acting like 
mere men? 

4 For when one says, "I follow Paul," and 
another, "I follow Apollos," are you not 
mere men? 

5 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is 
Paul? Only servants, through whom you 
came to believe-as the Lord has 
assigned to each his task. 

6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, 
but God made it grow. 

7 So neither he who plants nor he who 
waters is anything, but only God, who 
makes things grow. 

8 The man who plants and the man who 
waters have one purpose, and each will 
be rewarded according to his own labor. 

9 For we are God's fellow workers; you 
are God's field, God's building. 



By the grace God has given me, I laid 
a foundation as an expert builder, and 
someone else is building on it. But each 
one should be careful how he builds. 

"For no one can lay any foundation 
other than the one already laid, which is 
Jesus Christ. 

12 lf any man builds on this foundation 
using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, 
hay or straw, 



and again, "The Lord knows that the 
thoughts of the wise are futile." 

21 So then, no more boasting about men! 
All things are yours, 

22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or 
the world or life or death or the present 
or the future-all are yours, 

23 and you are of Christ, and Christ is of 
God. 



his work will be shown for what it is, 
because the Day will bring it to light. It 
will be revealed with fire, and the fire will 
test the quality of each man's work. 

14 lf what he has built survives, he will 
receive his reward. 

15 lf it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he 
himself will be saved, but only as one 
escaping through the flames. 

16 Don't you know that you yourselves 
are God's temple and that God's Spirit 
lives in you? 

17 lf anyone destroys God's temple, God 
will destroy him; for God's temple is 
sacred, and you are that temple. 

18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any one 
of you thinks he is wise by the standards 
of this age, he should become a "fool" 
so that he may become wise. 

19 For the wisdom of this world is 
foolishness in God's sight. As it is 
written: "He catches the wise in their 
craftiness" ; 



tSo then, men ought to regard us as 

servants of Christ and as those 
entrusted with the secret things of God. 

2 Now it is required that those who have 
been given a trust must prove faithful. 

3 I care very little if I am judged by you or 
by any human court; indeed, I do not 
even judge myself. 

4 My conscience is clear, but that does 
not make me innocent. It is the Lord 
who judges me. 

therefore judge nothing before the 
appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. 
He will bring to light what is hidden in 
darkness and will expose the motives of 
men's hearts. At that time each will 
receive his praise from God. 

6 Now, brothers, I have applied these 
things to myself and Apollos for your 
benefit, so that you may learn from us 
the meaning of the saying, "Do not go 
beyond what is written." Then you will 
not take pride in one man over against 
another. 



For who makes you different from 
anyone else? What do you have that 
you did not receive? And if you did 
receive it, why do you boast as though 
you did not? 

8 Already you have all you want! Already 
you have become rich! You have 
become kings-and that without us! How 
I wish that you really had become kings 
so that we might be kings with you! 

9 For it seems to me that God has put us 
apostles on display at the end of the 
procession, like men condemned to die 
in the arena. We have been made a 
spectacle to the whole universe, to 
angels as well as to men. 

10 We are fools for Christ, but you are so 
wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are 
strong! You are honored, we are 
dishonored! 

11 To this very hour we go hungry and 
thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally 
treated, we are homeless. 



many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I 
became your father through the gospel. 

16 Therefore I urge you to imitate me. 

17 For this reason I am sending to you 
Timothy, my son whom I love, who is 
faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of 
my way of life in Christ Jesus, which 
agrees with what I teach everywhere in 
every church. 

18 Some of you have become arrogant, 
as if I were not coming to you. 

19 But I will come to you very soon, if the 
Lord is willing, and then I will find out not 
only how these arrogant people are 
talking, but what power they have. 

20 For the kingdom of God is not a matter 
of talk but of power. 

21 What do you prefer? Shall I come to 
you with a whip, or in love and with a 
gentle spirit? 



We work hard with our own hands. 
When we are cursed, we bless; when 
we are persecuted, we endure it; 

13 when we are slandered, we answer 
kindly. Up to this moment we have 
become the scum of the earth, the 
refuse of the world. 

14 l am not writing this to shame you, but 
to warn you, as my dear children. 

15 Even though you have ten thousand 
guardians in Christ, you do not have 



wit is actually reported that there is 

sexual immorality among you, and of a 
kind that does not occur even among 
pagans: A man has his father's wife. 

2 And you are proud! Shouldn't you 
rather have been filled with grief and 
have put out of your fellowship the man 
who did this? 

3 Even though I am not physically 
present, I am with you in spirit. And I 
have already passed judgment on the 
one who did this, just as if I were 
present. 



4 When you are assembled in the name 
of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in 
spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus 
is present, 

5 hand this man over to Satan, so that 
the sinful nature may be destroyed and 
his spirit saved on the day of the Lord. 

6 Your boasting is not good. Don't you 
know that a little yeast works through 
the whole batch of dough? 

7 Get rid of the old yeast that you may be 
a new batch without yeast-as you really 
are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has 
been sacrificed. 

therefore let us keep the Festival, not 
with the old yeast, the yeast of malice 
and wickedness, but with bread without 
yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth. 

9 I have written you in my letter not to 
associate with sexually immoral people- 

10 not at all meaning the people of this 
world who are immoral, or the greedy 
and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case 
you would have to leave this world. 

11 But now I am writing you that you must 
not associate with anyone who calls 
himself a brother but is sexually immoral 
or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a 
drunkard or a swindler. With such a man 
do not even eat. 

12 What business is it of mine to judge 
those outside the church? Are you not to 
judge those inside? 



13 God will judge those outside. "Expel 
the wicked man from among you." 



Olf any of you has a dispute with 

another, dare he take it before the 
ungodly for judgment instead of before 
the saints? 

2 Do you not know that the saints will 
judge the world? And if you are to judge 
the world, are you not competent to 
judge trivial cases? 

3 Do you not know that we will judge 
angels? How much more the things of 
this life! 

therefore, if you have disputes about 
such matters, appoint as judges even 
men of little account in the church! 

5 I say this to shame you. Is it possible 
that there is nobody among you wise 
enough to judge a dispute between 
believers? 

6 But instead, one brother goes to law 
against another-and this in front of 
unbelievers! 

7 The very fact that you have lawsuits 
among you means you have been 
completely defeated already. Why not 
rather be wronged? Why not rather be 
cheated? 

instead, you yourselves cheat and do 
wrong, and you do this to your brothers. 

9 Do you not know that the wicked will 
not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not 
be deceived: Neither the sexually 



immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor 
male prostitutes nor homosexual 
offenders 

10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor 
drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers 
will inherit the kingdom of God. 



body, but he who sins sexually sins 
against his own body. 

19 Do you not know that your body is a 
temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, 
whom you have received from God? 
You are not your own; 



And that is what some of you were. 
But you were washed, you were 
sanctified, you were justified in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by 
the Spirit of our God. 

12 "Everything is permissible for me"-but 
not everything is beneficial. "Everything 



is permissible for me"-but I will 
mastered by anything. 



not be 



13 "Food for the stomach and the 
stomach for food"-but God will destroy 
them both. The body is not meant for 
sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and 
the Lord for the body. 

14 By his power God raised the Lord from 
the dead, and he will raise us also. 

15 Do you not know that your bodies are 
members of Christ himself? Shall I then 
take the members of Christ and unite 
them with a prostitute? Never! 

16 Do you not know that he who unites 
himself with a prostitute is one with her 
in body? For it is said, "The two will 
become one flesh." 

17 But he who unites himself with the 
Lord is one with him in spirit. 

18 Flee from sexual immorality. All other 
sins a man commits are outside his 



20 you were bought at a price. Therefore 
honor God with your body. 



f Now for the matters you wrote about: 
It is good for a man not to marry. 

2 But since there is so much immorality, 
each man should have his own wife, 
and each woman her own husband. 

3 The husband should fulfill his marital 
duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to 
her husband. 

4 The wife's body does not belong to her 
alone but also to her husband. In the 
same way, the husband's body does not 
belong to him alone but also to his wife. 

5 Do not deprive each other except by 
mutual consent and for a time, so that 
you may devote yourselves to prayer. 
Then come together again so that Satan 
will not tempt you because of your lack 
of self-control. 

6 I say this as a concession, not as a 
command. 

7 I wish that all men were as I am. But 
each man has his own gift from God; 
one has this gift, another has that. 



Now to the unmarried and the widows I 
say: It is good for them to stay 
unmarried, as I am. 

9 But if they cannot control themselves, 
they should marry, for it is better to 
marry than to burn with passion. 

10 To the married I give this command 
(not I, but the Lord): A wife must not 
separate from her husband. 



Nevertheless, each one should retain 
the place in life that the Lord assigned to 
him and to which God has called him. 
This is the rule I lay down in all the 
churches. 

18 Was a man already circumcised when 
he was called? He should not become 
uncircumcised. Was a man 
uncircumcised when he was called? He 
should not be circumcised. 



But if she does, she must remain 
unmarried or else be reconciled to her 
husband. And a husband must not 
divorce his wife. 

12 To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If 
any brother has a wife who is not a 
believer and she is willing to live with 
him, he must not divorce her. 

13 And if a woman has a husband who is 
not a believer and he is willing to live 
with her, she must not divorce him. 

14 For the unbelieving husband has been 
sanctified through his wife, and the 
unbelieving wife has been sanctified 
through her believing husband. 
Otherwise your children would be 
unclean, but as it is, they are holy. 



Circumcision is nothing and 
uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping 
God's commands is what counts. 

20 Each one should remain in the 
situation which he was in when God 
called him. 

21 Were you a slave when you were 
called? Don't let it trouble you-although 
if you can gain your freedom, do so. 

22 For he who was a slave when he was 
called by the Lord is the Lord's 
freedman; similarly, he who was a free 
man when he was called is Christ's 
slave. 

23 You were bought at a price; do not 
become slaves of men. 



But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do 
so. A believing man or woman is not 
bound in such circumstances; God has 
called us to live in peace. 

16 How do you know, wife, whether you 
will save your husband? Or, how do you 
know, husband, whether you will save 
your wife? 



Brothers, each man, as responsible to 
God, should remain in the situation God 
called him to. 

25 Now about virgins: I have no 
command from the Lord, but I give a 
judgment as one who by the Lord's 
mercy is trustworthy. 



Because of the present crisis, I think 
that it is good for you to remain as you 
are. 

27 Are you married? Do not seek a 
divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look 
for a wife. 

28 But if you do marry, you have not 
sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has 
not sinned. But those who marry will 
face many troubles in this life, and I 
want to spare you this. 

29 What I mean, brothers, is that the time 
is short. From now on those who have 
wives should live as if they had none; 

30 those who mourn, as if they did not; 
those who are happy, as if they were 
not; those who buy something, as if it 
were not theirs to keep; 

31 those who use the things of the world, 
as if not engrossed in them. For this 
world in its present form is passing away. 

32 l would like you to be free from 
concern. An unmarried man is 
concerned about the Lord's affairs-how 
he can please the Lord. 



I am saying this for your own good, not 
to restrict you, but that you may live in a 
right way in undivided devotion to the 
Lord. 

36 lf anyone thinks he is acting 
improperly toward the virgin he is 
engaged to, and if she is getting along in 
years and he feels he ought to marry, he 
should do as he wants. He is not sinning. 
They should get married. 

37 But the man who has settled the 
matter in his own mind, who is under no 
compulsion but has control over his own 
will, and who has made up his mind not 
to marry the virgin-this man also does 
the right thing. 

38 So then, he who marries the virgin 
does right, but he who does not marry 
her does even better. 

39 A woman is bound to her husband as 
long as he lives. But if her husband dies, 
she is free to marry anyone she wishes, 
but he must belong to the Lord. 

40 ln my judgment, she is happier if she 
stays as she is-and I think that I too 
have the Spirit of God. 



But a married man is concerned about 
the affairs of this world-how he can 
please his wife- 

34 and his interests are divided. An 
unmarried woman or virgin is concerned 
about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be 
devoted to the Lord in both body and 
spirit. But a married woman is 
concerned about the affairs of this 
world-how she can please her husband. 



8 



Now about food sacrificed to idols: 

We know that we all possess knowledge. 
Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 

2 The man who thinks he knows 
something does not yet know as he 
ought to know. 

3 But the man who loves God is known 
by God. 



So then, about eating food sacrificed to 
idols: We know that an idol is nothing at 
all in the world and that there is no God 
but one. 






Therefore, if what I eat causes my 
brother to fall into sin, I will never eat 
meat again, so that I will not cause him 
to fall. 



J For even if there are so-called gods, 
whether in heaven or on earth (as 
indeed there are many "gods" and many 
"lords"), 

6 yet for us there is but one God, the 
Father, from whom all things came and 
for whom we live; and there is but one 
Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all 
things came and through whom we live. 

'But not everyone knows this. Some 
people are still so accustomed to idols 
that when they eat such food they think 
of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, 
and since their conscience is weak, it is 
defiled. 

8 But food does not bring us near to God; 
we are no worse if we do not eat, and 
no better if we do. 

9 Be careful, however, that the exercise 
of your freedom does not become a 
stumbling block to the weak. 

10 For if anyone with a weak conscience 
sees you who have this knowledge 
eating in an idol's temple, won't he be 
emboldened to eat what has been 
sacrificed to idols? 

11 So this weak brother, for whom Christ 
died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 

12 When you sin against your brothers in 
this way and wound their weak 
conscience, you sin against Christ. 



57 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? 

Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are 
you not the result of my work in the 
Lord? 

2 Even though I may not be an apostle to 
others, surely I am to you! For you are 
the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. 

3 This is my defense to those who sit in 
judgment on me. 

4 Don't we have the right to food and 
drink? 

5 Don't we have the right to take a 
believing wife along with us, as do the 
other apostles and the Lord's brothers 
and Cephas ? 

6 Or is it only I and Barnabas who must 
work for a living? 

7 Who serves as a soldier at his own 
expense? Who plants a vineyard and 
does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a 
flock and does not drink of the milk? 

8 Do I say this merely from a human 
point of view? Doesn't the Law say the 
same thing? 

9 For it is written in the Law of Moses: 
"Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading 
out the grain." Is it about oxen that God 
is concerned? 



Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? 
Yes, this was written for us, because 
when the plowman plows and the 
thresher threshes, they ought to do so in 
the hope of sharing in the harvest. 

11 lf we have sown spiritual seed among 
you, is it too much if we reap a material 
harvest from you? 

12 lf others have this right of support from 
you, shouldn't we have it all the more? 

13 But we did not use this right. On the 
contrary, we put up with anything rather 
than hinder the gospel of Christ. Don't 
you know that those who work in the 
temple get their food from the temple, 
and those who serve at the altar share 
in what is offered on the altar? 

14 ln the same way, the Lord has 
commanded that those who preach the 
gospel should receive their living from 
the gospel. 

15 But I have not used any of these rights. 
And I am not writing this in the hope that 
you will do such things for me. I would 
rather die than have anyone deprive me 
of this boast. 

16 Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot 
boast, for I am compelled to preach. 
Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 

17 lf I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; 
if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging 
the trust committed to me. 

18 What then is my reward? Just this: that 
in preaching the gospel I may offer it 



free of charge, and so not make use of 
my rights in preaching it. 

19 Though I am free and belong to no 
man, I make myself a slave to everyone, 
to win as many as possible. 

20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to 
win the Jews. To those under the law I 
became like one under the law (though I 
myself am not under the law), so as to 
win those under the law. 

21 To those not having the law I became 
like one not having the law (though I am 
not free from God's law but am under 
Christ's law), so as to win those not 
having the law. 

22 To the weak I became weak, to win 
the weak. I have become all things to all 
men so that by all possible means I 
might save some. 

23 l do all this for the sake of the gospel, 
that I may share in its blessings. 

24 Do you not know that in a race all the 
runners run, but only one gets the prize? 
Run in such a way as to get the prize. 

25 Everyone who competes in the games 
goes into strict training. They do it to get 
a crown that will not last; but we do it to 
get a crown that will last forever. 

26 Therefore I do not run like a man 
running aimlessly; I do not fight like a 
man beating the air. 

27 No, I beat my body and make it my 
slave so that after I have preached to 



others, I myself will 
for the prize.

10, 



'For I do not want you to be 

ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our 
forefathers were all under the cloud and 
that they all passed through the sea. 

2 They were all baptized into Moses in 
the cloud and in the sea. 

3 They all ate the same spiritual food 

4 and drank the same spiritual drink; for 
they drank from the spiritual rock that 
accompanied them, and that rock was 
Christ. 

Nevertheless, God was not pleased 
with most of them; their bodies were 
scattered over the desert. 

6 Now these things occurred as 
examples to keep us from setting our 
hearts on evil things as they did. 

7 Do not be idolaters, as some of them 
were; as it is written: "The people sat 
down to eat and drink and got up to 
indulge in pagan revelry." 

8 We should not commit sexual 
immorality, as some of them did-and in 
one day twenty-three thousand of them 
died. 

9 We should not test the Lord, as some 
of them did-and were killed by snakes. 



And do not grumble, as some of them 
did-and were killed by the destroying 
angel. 

"These things happened to them as 
examples and were written down as 
warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment 
of the ages has come. 

12 So, if you think you are standing firm, 
be careful that you don't fall! 

13 No temptation has seized you except 
what is common to man. And God is 
faithful; he will not let you be tempted 
beyond what you can bear. But when 
you are tempted, he will also provide a 
way out so that you can stand up under 
it. 

14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from 
idolatry. 

15 l speak to sensible people; judge for 
yourselves what I say. 

16 ls not the cup of thanksgiving for which 
we give thanks a participation in the 
blood of Christ? And is not the bread 
that we break a participation in the body 
of Christ? 

17 Because there is one loaf, we, who are 
many, are one body, for we all partake 
of the one loaf. 

18 Consider the people of Israel: Do not 
those who eat the sacrifices participate 
in the altar? 

19 Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered 
to an idol is anything, or that an idol is 
anything? 



No, but the sacrifices of pagans are 
offered to demons, not to God, and I do 
not want you to be participants with 
demons. 

21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord 
and the cup of demons too; you cannot 
have a part in both the Lord's table and 
the table of demons. 

22 Are we trying to arouse the Lord's 
jealousy? Are we stronger than he? 

23 "Everything is permissible"-but not 
everything is beneficial. "Everything is 
permissible"-but 
constructive. 



not everything is 



24 Nobody should seek his own good, but 
the good of others. 

25 Eat anything sold in the meat market 
without raising questions of conscience,

everything in it." 



is the Lord's, and 



If some unbeliever invites you to a 
meal and you want to go, eat whatever 
is put before you without raising 
questions of conscience. 

28 But if anyone says to you, "This has 
been offered in sacrifice," then do not 
eat it, both for the sake of the man who 
told you and for conscience' sake -- 

29 the other man's conscience, I mean, 
not yours. For why should my freedom 
be judged by another's conscience? 



If I take part in the meal with 
thankfulness, why am I denounced 
because of something I thank God for? 

31 So whether you eat or drink or 
whatever you do, do it all for the glory of 
God. 



Do not cause anyone to stumble, 
whether Jews, Greeks or the church of 
God- 

33 even as I try to please everybody in 
every way. For I am not seeking my own 
good but the good of many, so that they 
may be saved. 



11 



Follow my example, as I follow the 
example of Christ. 

2 I praise you for remembering me in 
everything and for holding to the 
teachings, just as I passed them on to 
you. 

3 Now I want you to realize that the head 
of every man is Christ, and the head of 
the woman is man, and the head of 
Christ is God. 

4 Every man who prays or prophesies 
with his head covered dishonors his 
head. 

5 And every woman who prays or 
prophesies with her head uncovered 
dishonors her head-it is just as though 
her head were shaved. 

6 lf a woman does not cover her head, 
she should have her hair cut off; and if it 
is a disgrace for a woman to have her 



hair cut or shaved off, she should cover 
her head. 

7 A man ought not to cover his head, 
since he is the image and glory of God; 
but the woman is the glory of man. 

8 For man did not come from woman, but 
woman from man; 

9 neither was man created for woman, 
but woman for man. 



17 ln the following directives I have no 
praise for you, for your meetings do 
more harm than good. 

18 ln the first place, I hear that when you 
come together as a church, there are 
divisions among you, and to some 
extent I believe it. 

19 No doubt there have to be differences 
among you to show which of you have 
God's approval. 



For this reason, and because of the 
angels, the woman ought to have a sign 
of authority on her head. 

11 ln the Lord, however, woman is not 
independent of man, nor is man 
independent of woman. 

12 For as woman came from man, so 
also man is born of woman. But 
everything comes from God. 

13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a 
woman to pray to God with her head 
uncovered? 

14 Does not the very nature of things 
teach you that if a man has long hair, it 
is a disgrace to him, 

15 but that if a woman has long hair, it is 
her glory? For long hair is given to her 
as a covering. 

16 lf anyone wants to be contentious 
about this, we have no other practice- 
nor do the churches of God. 



20 When you come together, it is not the 
Lord's Supper you eat, 

21 for as you eat, each of you goes 
ahead without waiting for anybody else. 
One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 

22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink 
in? Or do you despise the church of God 
and humiliate those who have nothing? 
What shall I say to you? Shall I praise 
you for this? Certainly not! 

23 For I received from the Lord what I 
also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, 
on the night he was betrayed, took 
bread, 

24 and when he had given thanks, he 
broke it and said, "This is my body, 
which is for you; do this in remembrance 
of me." 

25 ln the same way, after supper he took 
the cup, saying, "This cup is the new 
covenant in my blood; do this, whenever 
you drink it, in remembrance of me." 



For whenever you eat this bread and 
drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's 
death until he comes. 



You know that when you were pagans, 
somehow or other you were influenced 
and led astray to mute idols. 



Therefore, whoever eats the bread or 
drinks the cup of the Lord in an 
unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning 
against the body and blood of the Lord. 



^Therefore I tell you that no one who is 
speaking by the Spirit of God says, 
"Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, 
"Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit. 



A man ought to examine himself 
before he eats of the bread and drinks 
of the cup. 

29 For anyone who eats and drinks 
without recognizing the body of the Lord 
eats and drinks judgment on himself. 

30 That is why many among you are 
weak and sick, and a number of you 
have fallen asleep. 

31 But if we judged ourselves, we would 
not come under judgment. 

32 When we are judged by the Lord, we 
are being disciplined so that we will not 
be condemned with the world. 

33 So then, my brothers, when you come 
together to eat, wait for each other. 

34 lf anyone is hungry, he should eat at 
home, so that when you meet together it 
may not result in judgment. And when I 
come I will give further directions. 



12, 



.Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, 
I do not want you to be ignorant. 



4 There are different kinds of gifts, but 
the same Spirit. 



There are different kinds of service, but 
the same Lord. 

6 There are different kinds of working, but 
the same God works all of them in all 
men. 



7 Now to each one the manifestation of 
the Spirit is given for the common good. 

8 To one there is given through the Spirit 
the message of wisdom, to another the 
message of knowledge by means of the 
same Spirit, 

9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to 
another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 

10 to another miraculous powers, to 
another prophecy, to another 
distinguishing between spirits, to 
another speaking in different kinds of 
tongues, and to still another the 
interpretation of tongues. 

1 1 All these are the work of one and the 
same Spirit, and he gives them to each 
one, just as he determines. 



The body is a unit, though it is made 
up of many parts; and though all its 



parts are many, they form one body. So 
it is with Christ. 

13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit 
into one body-whether Jews or Greeks, 
slave or free-and we were all given the 
one Spirit to drink. 

14 Now the body is not made up of one 
part but of many. 

15 lf the foot should say, "Because I am 
not a hand, I do not belong to the body," 
it would not for that reason cease to be 
part of the body. 

16 And if the ear should say, "Because I 
am not an eye, I do not belong to the 
body," it would not for that reason cease 
to be part of the body. 

17 lf the whole body were an eye, where 
would the sense of hearing be? If the 
whole body were an ear, where would 
the sense of smell be? 

18 But in fact God has arranged the parts 
in the body, every one of them, just as 
he wanted them to be. 



and the parts that we think are less 
honorable we treat with special honor. 
And the parts that are unpresentable are 
treated with special modesty, 

24 while our presentable parts need no 
special treatment. But God has 
combined the members of the body and 
has given greater honor to the parts that 
lacked it, 

25 so that there should be no division in 
the body, but that its parts should have 
equal concern for each other. 

26 lf one part suffers, every part suffers 
with it; if one part is honored, every part 
rejoices with it. 

27 Now you are the body of Christ, and 
each one of you is a part of it. 



And in the church God has appointed 
first of all apostles, second prophets, 
third teachers, then workers of miracles, 
also those having gifts of healing, those 
able to help others, those with gifts of 
administration, and those speaking in 
different kinds of tongues. 



19 lf they were all one part, where would 
the body be? 

20 As it is, there are many parts, but one 
body. 

21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I 
don't need you!" And the head cannot 
say to the feet, "I don't need you!" 



Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are 
all teachers? Do all work miracles? 

30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all 
speak in tongues ? Do all interpret? 

31 But eagerly desire the greater gifts. 
And now I will show you the most 
excellent way. 



22 0n the contrary, those parts of the 
body that seem to be weaker are 
indispensable, 



13, 



Mf I speak in the tongues of men 
and of angels, but have not love, I am 



only a resounding gong or a clanging 
cymbal. 

2 lf I have the gift of prophecy and can 
fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, 
and if I have a faith that can move 
mountains, but have not love, I am 
nothing. 



Now we see but a poor reflection as in 
a mirror; then we shall see face to face. 
Now I know in part; then I shall know 
fully, even as I am fully known. 

13 And now these three remain: faith, 
hope and love. But the greatest of these 
is love. 



3 lf I give all I possess to the poor and 
surrender my body to the flames, but 
have not love, I gain nothing. 

4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not 
envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 

5 lt is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is 
not easily angered, it keeps no record of 
wrongs. 

6 Love does not delight in evil but 
rejoices with the truth. 

7 lt always protects, always trusts, 
always hopes, always perseveres. 

8 Love never fails. But where there are 
prophecies, they will cease; where there 
are tongues, they will be stilled; where 
there is knowledge, it will pass away. 

9 For we know in part and we prophesy 
in part,

but when perfection 
imperfect disappears. 



comes, 



the 



When I was a child, I talked like a child, 
I thought like a child, I reasoned like a 
child. When I became a man, I put 
childish ways behind me. 



"Follow the way of love and 

eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially 
the gift of prophecy. 

2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue 
does not speak to men but to God. 
Indeed, no one understands him; he 
utters mysteries with his spirit. 

3 But everyone who prophesies speaks 
to men for their strengthening, 
encouragement and comfort. 

4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies 
himself, but he who prophesies edifies 
the church. 

5 I would like every one of you to speak 
in tongues, but I would rather have you 
prophesy. He who prophesies is greater 
than one who speaks in tongues, unless 
he interprets, so that the church may be 
edified. 

6 Now, brothers, if I come to you and 
speak in tongues, what good will I be to 
you, unless I bring you some revelation 
or knowledge or prophecy or word of 
instruction? 

7 Even in the case of lifeless things that 
make sounds, such as the flute or harp, 
how will anyone know what tune is 



being played unless there is a distinction 
in the notes? 



You may be giving thanks well enough, 
but the other man is not edified. 



8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a 
clear call, who will get ready for battle? 



18 l thank God that I speak in tongues 
more than all of you. 



So it is with you. Unless you speak 
intelligible words with your tongue, how 
will anyone know what you are saying? 
You will just be speaking into the air. 

10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of 
languages in the world, yet none of 
them is without meaning. 

11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of 
what someone is saying, I am a 
foreigner to the speaker, and he is a 
foreigner to me. 

12 So it is with you. Since you are eager 
to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts 
that build up the church. 

13 For this reason anyone who speaks in 
a tongue should pray that he may 
interpret what he says. 

14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit 
prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 

15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my 
spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I 
will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing 
with my mind. 

16 lf you are praising God with your spirit, 
how can one who finds himself among 
those who do not understand say 
"Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he 
does not know what you are saying? 



But in the church I would rather speak 
five intelligible words to instruct others 
than ten thousand words in a tongue. 

20 Brothers, stop thinking like children. In 
regard to evil be infants, but in your 
thinking be adults. 

21 ln the Law it is written: "Through men 
of strange tongues and through the lips 
of foreigners I will speak to this people, 
but even then they will not listen to me," 
says the Lord. 

22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for 
believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, 
however, is for believers, not for 
unbelievers. 

23 So if the whole church comes together 
and everyone speaks in tongues, and 
some who do not understand or some 
unbelievers come in, will they not say 
that you are out of your mind? 

24 But if an unbeliever or someone who 
does not understand comes in while 
everybody is prophesying, he will be 
convinced by all that he is a sinner and 
will be judged by all, 

25 and the secrets of his heart will be laid 
bare. So he will fall down and worship 
God, exclaiming, "God is really among 
you!" 



What then shall we say, brothers? 
When you come together, everyone has 
a hymn, or a word of instruction, a 
revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. 
All of these must be done for the 
strengthening of the church. 

27 lf anyone speaks in a tongue, two-or 
at the most three-should speak, one at 
a time, and someone must interpret. 

28 lf there is no interpreter, the speaker 
should keep quiet in the church and 
speak to himself and God. 

29 Two or three prophets should speak, 
and the others should weigh carefully 
what is said. 

30 And if a revelation comes to someone 
who is sitting down, the first speaker 
should stop. 

31 For you can all prophesy in turn so 
that everyone may be instructed and 
encouraged. 

32 The spirits of prophets are subject to 
the control of prophets. 

33 For God is not a God of disorder but of 
peace. 

34 As in all the congregations of the 
saints, women should remain silent in 
the churches. They are not allowed to 
speak, but must be in submission, as 
the Law says. 

35 lf they want to inquire about something, 
they should ask their own husbands at 
home; for it is disgraceful for a woman 
to speak in the church. 



Did the word of God originate with 
you? Or are you the only people it has 
reached? 

37 lf anybody thinks he is a prophet or 
spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge 
that what I am writing to you is the 
Lord's command. 

38 lf he ignores this, he himself will be 
ignored. 

39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to 
prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in 
tongues. 

40 But everything should be done in a 
fitting and orderly way. 

I ONow, brothers, I want to remind 

you of the gospel I preached to you, 
which you received and on which you 
have taken your stand. 

2 By this gospel you are saved, if you 
hold firmly to the word I preached to you. 
Otherwise, you have believed in vain. 

3 For what I received I passed on to you 
as of first importance : that Christ died 
for our sins according to the Scriptures, 

4 that he was buried, that he was raised 
on the third day according to the 
Scriptures, 

5 and that he appeared to Peter, and 
then to the Twelve. 

6 After that, he appeared to more than 
five hundred of the brothers at the same 



time, most of whom are still living, 
though some have fallen asleep. 



For if the dead are not raised, 
Christ has not been raised either. 



then 



Then he appeared to James, then to all 
the apostles, 

8 and last of all he appeared to me also, 
as to one abnormally born. 



17 And if Christ has not been raised, your 
faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 

18 Then those also who have fallen 
asleep in Christ are lost. 



For I am the least of the apostles and 
do not even deserve to be called an 
apostle, because I persecuted the 
church of God. 

10 But by the grace of God I am what I 
am, and his grace to me was not without 
effect. No, I worked harder than all of 
them-yet not I, but the grace of God 
that was with me. 

"Whether, then, it was I or they, this is 
what we preach, and this is what you 
believed. 

12 But if it is preached that Christ has 
been raised from the dead, how can 
some of you say that there is no 
resurrection of the dead? 

13 lf there is no resurrection of the dead, 
then not even Christ has been raised. 

14 And if Christ has not been raised, our 
preaching is useless and so is your faith. 

15 More than that, we are then found to 
be false witnesses about God, for we 
have testified about God that he raised 
Christ from the dead. But he did not 
raise him if in fact the dead are not 
raised. 



If only for this life we have hope in 
Christ, we are to be pitied more than all 
men. 

20 But Christ has indeed been raised 
from the dead, the firstfruits of those 
who have fallen asleep. 

21 For since death came through a man, 
the resurrection of the dead comes also 
through a man. 

22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all 
will be made alive. 

23 But each in his own turn: Christ, the 
firstfruits; then, when he comes, those 
who belong to him. 

24 Then the end will come, when he 

hands over the kingdom to God the 

Father after he has destroyed all 
dominion, authority and power. 

25 For he must reign until he has put all 
his enemies under his feet. 

26 The last enemy to be destroyed is 
death. 

27 For he "has put everything under his 
feet." Now when it says that "everything" 
has been put under him, it is clear that 



this does not include God himself, who 
put everything under Christ. 

28 When he has done this, then the Son 
himself will be made subject to him who 
put everything under him, so that God 
may be all in all. 



But God gives it a body as he has 
determined, and to each kind of seed he 
gives its own body. 

39 AII flesh is not the same: Men have 
one kind of flesh, animals have another, 
birds another and fish another. 



Now if there is no resurrection, what 
will those do who are baptized for the 
dead? If the dead are not raised at all, 
why are people baptized for them? 

30 And as for us, why do we endanger 
ourselves every hour? 

31 1 die every day-l mean that, brothers- 
just as surely as I glory over you in 
Christ Jesus our Lord. 

32 lf I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for 
merely human reasons, what have I 
gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let 
us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." 



Do not be misled: "Bad 
corrupts good character." 



company 



Come back to your senses as you 
ought, and stop sinning; for there are 
some who are ignorant of God-I say 
this to your shame. 

35 But someone may ask, "How are the 
dead raised? With what kind of body will 
they come?" 



There are also heavenly bodies and 
there are earthly bodies; but the 
splendor of the heavenly bodies is one 
kind, and the splendor of the earthly 
bodies is another. 

41 The sun has one kind of splendor, the 
moon another and the stars another; 
and star differs from star in splendor. 

42 So will it be with the resurrection of the 
dead. The body that is sown is 
perishable, it is raised imperishable; 

43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in 
glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised 
in power; 

44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a 
spiritual body. If there is a natural body, 
there is also a spiritual body. 

45 So it is written: "The first man Adam 
became a living being" ; the last Adam, 
a lifegiving spirit. 

46 The spiritual did not come first, but the 
natural, and after that the spiritual. 



How foolish! What you sow does not 
come to life unless it dies. 



The first man was of the dust of the 
earth, the second man from heaven. 



37 When you sow, you do not plant the 
body that will be, but just a seed, 
perhaps of wheat or of something else. 



48 As was the earthly man, so are those 
who are of the earth; and as is the man 



from heaven, so also are those who are 
of heaven. 



because you know that your labor in the 
Lord is not in vain. 



And just as we have borne the 
likeness of the earthly man, so shall we 
bear the likeness of the man from 
heaven. 

50 l declare to you, brothers, that flesh 
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of 
God, nor does the perishable inherit the 
imperishable. 

51 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not 
all sleep, but we will all be changed- 

52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at 
the last trumpet. For the trumpet will 
sound, the dead will be raised 
imperishable, and we will be changed. 

53 For the perishable must clothe itself 
with the imperishable, and the mortal 
with immortality. 

54 When the perishable has been clothed 
with the imperishable, and the mortal 
with immortality, then the saying that is 
written will come true: "Death has been 
swallowed up in victory." 

55 "Where, O death, is your victory? 
Where, O death, is your sting?" 

56 The sting of death is sin, and the 
power of sin is the law. 

57 But thanks be to God! He gives us the 
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 

58 Therefore, my dear brothers, stand 
firm. Let nothing move you. Always give 
yourselves fully to the work of the Lord,

Now about the collection for God's 
I told the Galatian 



people: Do what 
churches to do. 



On the first day of every week, each 
one of you should set aside a sum of 
money in keeping with his income, 
saving it up, so that when I come no 
collections will have to be made. 

3 Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of 
introduction to the men you approve and 
send them with your gift to Jerusalem. 

4 lf it seems advisable for me to go also, 
they will accompany me. 

5 After I go through Macedonia, I will 
come to you-for I will be going through 
Macedonia. 

6 Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or 
even spend the winter, so that you can 
help me on my journey, wherever I go. 

7 I do not want to see you now and make 
only a passing visit; I hope to spend 
some time with you, if the Lord permits. 

8 But I will stay on at Ephesus until 
Pentecost, 

9 because a great door for effective work 
has opened to me, and there are many 
who oppose me. 

10 lf Timothy comes, see to it that he has 
nothing to fear while he is with you, for 



he is carrying on the work of the Lord, 
just as I am. 

11 No one, then, should refuse to accept 
him. Send him on his way in peace so 
that he may return to me. I am expecting 
him along with the brothers. 

12 Now about our brother Apollos: I 
strongly urged him to go to you with the 
brothers. He was quite unwilling to go 
now, but he will go when he has the 
opportunity. 

13 Be on your guard; stand firm in the 
faith; be men of courage; be strong. 

14 Do everything in love. 

15 You know that the household of 
Stephanas were the first converts in 
Achaia, and they have devoted 
themselves to the service of the saints. I 
urge you, brothers, 

16 to submit to such as these and to 
everyone who joins in the work, and 
labors at it. 



I was glad when Stephanas, 
Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, 
because they have supplied what was 
lacking from you. 

18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours 
also. Such men deserve recognition. 

19 The churches in the province of Asia 
send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla 
greet you warmly in the Lord, and so 
does the church that meets at their 
house. 

20 AII the brothers here send you 
greetings. Greet one another with a holy 
kiss. 

21 1, Paul, write this greeting in my own 
hand. 

22 lf anyone does not love the Lord-a 
curse be on him. Come, O Lord ! 



23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with 
you. 

24 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. 
Amen. 



2nd Corinthians 



1 



our ability to endure, 
despaired even of life. 



so that we 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by 

the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
To the church of God in Corinth, 
together with all the saints throughout 
Achaia: 

2 Grace and peace to you from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

3 Praise be to the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of 
compassion and the God of all comfort, 

4 who comforts us in all our troubles, so 
that we can comfort those in any trouble 
with the comfort we ourselves have 
received from God. 

5 For just as the sufferings of Christ flow 
over into our lives, so also through 
Christ our comfort overflows. 

6 lf we are distressed, it is for your 
comfort and salvation; if we are 
comforted, it is for your comfort, which 
produces in you patient endurance of 
the same sufferings we suffer. 

7 And our hope for you is firm, because 
we know that just as you share in our 
sufferings, so also you share in our 
comfort. 

8 We do not want you to be uninformed, 
brothers, about the hardships we 
suffered in the province of Asia. We 
were under great pressure, far beyond 



Indeed, in our hearts we felt the 
sentence of death. But this happened 
that we might not rely on ourselves but 
on God, who raises the dead. 

10 He has delivered us from such a 
deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On 
him we have set our hope that he will 
continue to deliver us, 

11 as you help us by your prayers. Then 
many will give thanks on our behalf for 
the gracious favor granted us in answer 
to the prayers of many. 

12 Now this is our boast: Our conscience 
testifies that we have conducted 
ourselves in the world, and especially in 
our relations with you, in the holiness 
and sincerity that are from God. We 
have done so not according to worldly 
wisdom but according to God's grace. 

13 For we do not write you anything you 
cannot read or understand. And I hope 
that, 

14 as you have understood us in part, you 
will come to understand fully that you 
can boast of us just as we will boast of 
you in the day of the Lord Jesus. 

15 Because I was confident of this, I 
planned to visit you first so that you 
might benefit twice. 



16 l planned to visit you on my way to 
Macedonia and to come back to you 
from Macedonia, and then to have you 
send me on my way to Judea. 

17 When I planned this, did I do it lightly? 
Or do I make my plans in a worldly 
manner so that in the same breath I say, 
"Yes, yes" and "No, no"? 

18 But as surely as God is faithful, our 
message to you is not "Yes" and "No." 

19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who 
was preached among you by me and 
Silas and Timothy, was not "Yes" and 
"No," but in him it has always been 
"Yes." 



For if I grieve you, who is left to make 
me glad but you whom I have grieved? 

3 I wrote as I did so that when I came I 
should not be distressed by those who 
ought to make me rejoice. I had 
confidence in all of you, that you would 
all share my joy. 

4 For I wrote you out of great distress 
and anguish of heart and with many 
tears, not to grieve you but to let you 
know the depth of my love for you. 

5 lf anyone has caused grief, he has not 
so much grieved me as he has grieved 
all of you, to some extent-not to put it 
too severely. 



For no matter how many promises 
God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. 
And so through him the "Amen" is 
spoken by us to the glory of God. 

21 Now it is God who makes both us and 
you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, 

22 set his seal of ownership on us, and 
put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, 
guaranteeing what is to come. 

23 l call God as my witness that it was in 
order to spare you that I did not return to 
Corinth. 

24 Not that we lord it over your faith, but 
we work with you for your joy, because it 
is by faith you stand firm. 



fcSo I made up my mind that I would 
not make another painful visit to you. 



6 The punishment inflicted on him by the 
majority is sufficient for him. 

7 Now instead, you ought to forgive and 
comfort him, so that he will not be 
overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 

8 I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your 
love for him. 

9 The reason I wrote you was to see if 
you would stand the test and be 
obedient in everything. 

10 lf you forgive anyone, I also forgive 
him. And what I have forgivenâ€” if there 
was anything to forgiveâ€” I have forgiven 
in the sight of Christ for your sake, 

11 in order that Satan might not outwit us. 
For we are not unaware of his schemes. 



12 Now when I went to Troas to preach 
the gospel of Christ and found that the 
Lord had opened a door for me, 

13 l still had no peace of mind, because I 
did not find my brother Titus there. So I 
said good-by to them and went on to 
Macedonia. 

14 But thanks be to God, who always 
leads us in triumphal procession in 
Christ and through us spreads 
everywhere the fragrance of the 
knowledge of him. 

15 For we are to God the aroma of Christ 
among those who are being saved and 
those who are perishing. 



Such confidence as this is ours through 
Christ before God. 

5 Not that we are competent in ourselves 
to claim anything for ourselves, but our 
competence comes from God. 

6 He has made us competent as 
ministers of a new covenant-not of the 
letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, 
but the Spirit gives life. 

7 Now if the ministry that brought death, 
which was engraved in letters on stone, 
came with glory, so that the Israelites 
could not look steadily at the face of 
Moses because of its glory, fading 
though it was, 



To the one we are the smell of death; 
to the other, the fragrance of life. And 
who is equal to such a task? 

17 Unlike so many, we do not peddle the 
word of God for profit. On the contrary, 
in Christ we speak before God with 
sincerity, like men sent from God. 



OAre we beginning to commend 

ourselves again? Or do we need, like 
some people, letters of recommendation 
to you or from you? 



will not the ministry of the Spirit be even 
more glorious? 

9 lf the ministry that condemns men is 
glorious, how much more glorious is the 
ministry that brings righteousness! 

10 For what was glorious has no glory 
now in comparison with the surpassing 
glory. 

11 And if what was fading away came 
with glory, how much greater is the glory 
of that which lasts! 



You yourselves are our letter, written 
on our hearts, known and read by 
everybody. 

3 You show that you are a letter from 
Christ, the result of our ministry, written 
not with ink but with the Spirit of the 
living God, not on tablets of stone but on 
tablets of human hearts. 



Therefore, since we have such a hope, 
we are very bold. 

13 We are not like Moses, who would put 
a veil over his face to keep the Israelites 
from gazing at it while the radiance was 
fading away. 



But their minds were made dull, for to 
this day the same veil remains when the 
old covenant is read. It has not been 
removed, because only in Christ is it 
taken away. 

15 Even to this day when Moses is read, 
a veil covers their hearts. 

16 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, 
the veil is taken away. 

17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where 
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 

18 And we, who with unveiled faces all 
reflect the Lord's glory, are being 
transformed into his likeness with ever- 
increasing glory, which comes from the 
Lord, who is the Spirit. 



For we do not preach ourselves, but 
Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as 
your servants for Jesus' sake. 

6 For God, who said, "Let light shine out 
of darkness," made his light shine in our 
hearts to give us the light of the 
knowledge of the glory of God in the 
face of Christ. 

7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay 
to show that this all-surpassing power is 
from God and not from us. 

8 We are hard pressed on every side, but 
not crushed; perplexed, but not in 
despair; 

persecuted, but not abandoned; struck 
down, but not destroyed. 



^Therefore, since through God's 

mercy we have this ministry, we do not 
lose heart. 

2 Rather, we have renounced secret and 
shameful ways; we do not use 
deception, nor do we distort the word of 
God. On the contrary, by setting forth 
the truth plainly we commend ourselves 
to every man's conscience in the sight of 
God. 

3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is 
veiled to those who are perishing. 

4 The god of this age has blinded the 
minds of unbelievers, so that they 
cannot see the light of the gospel of the 
glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 



We always carry around in our body 
the death of Jesus, so that the life of 
Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 

11 For we who are alive are always being 
given over to death for Jesus' sake, so 
that his life may be revealed in our 
mortal body. 

12 So then, death is at work in us, but life 
is at work in you. 

13 lt is written: "I believed; therefore I 
have spoken." With that same spirit of 
faith we also believe and therefore 
speak, 

14 because we know that the one who 
raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will 
also raise us with Jesus and present us 
with you in his presence. 



15 AII this is for your benefit, so that the 
grace that is reaching more and more 
people may cause thanksgiving to 
overflow to the glory of God. 

16 Therefore we do not lose heart. 
Though outwardly we are wasting away, 
yet inwardly we are being renewed day 
by day. 



therefore we are always confident and 
know that as long as we are at home in 
the body we are away from the Lord. 

7 We live by faith, not by sight. 

8 We are confident, I say, and would 
prefer to be away from the body and at 
home with the Lord. 



17 For our light and momentary troubles 
are achieving for us an eternal glory that 
far outweighs them all. 

18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, 
but on what is unseen. For what is seen 
is temporary, but what is unseen is 
eternal. 



9 So we make it our goal to please him, 
whether we are at home in the body or 
away from it. 

10 For we must all appear before the 
judgment seat of Christ, that each one 
may receive what is due him for the 
things done while in the body, whether 
good or bad. 



^Now we know that if the earthly tent 

we live in is destroyed, we have a 
building from God, an eternal house in 
heaven, not built by human hands. 



Since, then, we know what it is to fear 
the Lord, we try to persuade men. What 
we are is plain to God, and I hope it is 
also plain to your conscience. 



Meanwhile we groan, longing to be 
clothed with our heavenly dwelling, 

3 because when we are clothed, we will 
not be found naked. 

4 For while we are in this tent, we groan 
and are burdened, because we do not 
wish to be unclothed but to be clothed 
with our heavenly dwelling, so that what 
is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 

5 Now it is God who has made us for this 
very purpose and has given us the Spirit 
as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to 
come. 



We are not trying to commend 
ourselves to you again, but are giving 
you an opportunity to take pride in us, 
so that you can answer those who take 
pride in what is seen rather than in what 
is in the heart. 

13 lf we are out of our mind, it is for the 
sake of God; if we are in our right mind, 
it is for you. 

14 For Christ's love compels us, because 
we are convinced that one died for all, 
and therefore all died. 

15 And he died for all, that those who live 
should no longer live for themselves but 



for him who died for them and was 
raised again. 

16 So from now on we regard no one 
from a worldly point of view. Though we 
once regarded Christ in this way, we do 
so no longer. 

17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is 
a new creation; the old has gone, the 
new has come! 



We put no stumbling block in anyone's 
path, so that our ministry will not be 
discredited. 

4 Rather, as servants of God we 
commend ourselves in every way: in 
great endurance; in troubles, hardships 
and distresses; 

5 in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in 
hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; 



All this is from God, who reconciled us 
to himself through Christ and gave us 
the ministry of reconciliation: 

19 that God was reconciling the world to 
himself in Christ, not counting men's 



sins against 
committed to 
reconciliation. 



them. And he has 
us the message of 



We are therefore Christ's 
ambassadors, as though God were 
making his appeal through us. We 
implore you on Christ's behalf: Be 
reconciled to God. 

21 God made him who had no sin to be 
sin for us, so that in him we might 
become the righteousness of God. 



in purity, understanding, patience and 
kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in 
sincere love; 

7 in truthful speech and in the power of 
God; with weapons of righteousness in 
the right hand and in the left; 

through glory and dishonor, bad report 
and good report; genuine, yet regarded 
as impostors; 

9 known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, 
and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not 
killed; 

10 sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, 
yet making many rich; having nothing, 
and yet possessing everything. 



UAs God's fellow workers we urge you 
not to receive God's grace in vain. 

2 For he says, "In the time of my favor I 
heard you, and in the day of salvation I 
helped you." I tell you, now is the time of 
God's favor, now is the day of salvation. 



11 We have spoken freely to you, 
Corinthians, and opened wide our 
hearts to you. 

12 We are not withholding our affection 
from you, but you are withholding yours 
from us. 

13 As a fair exchange--! speak as to my 
children-open wide your hearts also. 



Do not be yoked together with 
unbelievers. For what do righteousness 
and wickedness have in common? Or 
what fellowship can light have with 
darkness? 

15 What harmony is there between Christ 
and Belial ? What does a believer have 
in common with an unbeliever? 



4 I have great confidence in you; I take 
great pride in you. I am greatly 
encouraged; in all our troubles my joy 
knows no bounds. 

5 For when we came into Macedonia, this 
body of ours had no rest, but we were 
harassed at every turn-conflicts on the 
outside, fears within. 



What agreement is there between the 
temple of God and idols? For we are the 
temple of the living God. As God has 
said: "I will live with them and walk 
among them, and I will be their God, 
and they will be my people." 

^"Therefore come out from them and be 
separate, says the Lord. Touch no 
unclean thing, and I will receive you." 

18 "l will be a Father to you, and you will 
be my sons and daughters, says the 
Lord Almighty." 



f Since we have these promises, dear 

friends, let us purify ourselves from 
everything that contaminates body and 
spirit, perfecting holiness out of 
reverence for God. 

2 Make room for us in your hearts. We 
have wronged no one, we have 
corrupted no one, we have exploited no 
one. 

3 I do not say this to condemn you; I 
have said before that you have such a 
place in our hearts that we would live or 
die with you. 



6 But God, who comforts the downcast, 
comforted us by the coming of Titus, 

7 and not only by his coming but also by 
the comfort you had given him. He told 
us about your longing for me, your deep 
sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so 
that my joy was greater than ever. 

8 Even if I caused you sorrow by my 
letter, I do not regret it. Though I did 
regret it-l see that my letter hurt you, 
but only for a little while- 
Vet now I am happy, not because you 
were made sorry, but because your 
sorrow led you to repentance. For you 
became sorrowful as God intended and 
so were not harmed in any way by us. 

10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that 
leads to salvation and leaves no regret, 
but worldly sorrow brings death. 

"See what this godly sorrow has 
produced in you: what earnestness, 
what eagerness to clear yourselves, 
what indignation, what alarm, what 
longing, what concern, what readiness 
to see justice done. At every point you 
have proved yourselves to be innocent 
in this matter. 



So even though I wrote to you, it was 
not on account of the one who did the 
wrong or of the injured party, but rather 
that before God you could see for 
yourselves how devoted to us you are. 

13 By all this we are encouraged. 

14 ln addition to our own encouragement, 
we were especially delighted to see how 
happy Titus was, because his spirit has 
been refreshed by all of you. I had 
boasted to him about you, and you have 
not embarrassed me. But just as 
everything we said to you was true, so 
our boasting about you to Titus has 
proved to be true as well. 

15 And his affection for you is all the 
greater when he remembers that you 
were all obedient, receiving him with 
fear and trembling. 

16 l am glad I can have complete 
confidence in you. 



And they did not do as we expected, 
but they gave themselves first to the 
Lord and then to us in keeping with 
God's will. 

6 So we urged Titus, since he had earlier 
made a beginning, to bring also to 
completion this act of grace on your part. 

7 But just as you excel in everything-in 
faith, in speech, in knowledge, in 
complete earnestness and in your love 
for us --see that you also excel in this 
grace of giving. 

8 I am not commanding you, but I want to 
test the sincerity of your love by 
comparing it with the earnestness of 
others. 

9 For you know the grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, 
yet for your sakes he became poor, so 
that you through his poverty might 
become rich. 



8 



And now, brothers, we want you to 

know about the grace that God has 
given the Macedonian churches. 

2 Out of the most severe trial, their 
overflowing joy and their extreme 
poverty welled up in rich generosity. 

3 For I testify that they gave as much as 
they were able, and even beyond their 
ability. Entirely on their own, 

4 they urgently pleaded with us for the 
privilege of sharing in this service to the 
saints. 



And here is my advice about what is 
best for you in this matter: Last year you 
were the first not only to give but also to 
have the desire to do so. 

"Now finish the work, so that your 
eager willingness to do it may be 
matched by your completion of it, 
according to your means. 

12 For if the willingness is there, the gift is 
acceptable according to what one has, 
not according to what he does not have. 

13 Our desire is not that others might be 
relieved while you are hard pressed, but 
that there might be equality. 



At the present time your plenty will 
supply what they need, so that in turn 
their plenty will supply what you need. 
Then there will be equality, 

15 as it is written: "He who gathered 
much did not have too much, and he 
who gathered little did not have too 
little." 

16 l thank God, who put into the heart of 
Titus the same concern I have for you. 

17 For Titus not only welcomed our 
appeal, but he is coming to you with 
much enthusiasm and on his own 
initiative. 

18 And we are sending along with him the 
brother who is praised by all the 
churches for his service to the gospel. 

19 What is more, he was chosen by the 
churches to accompany us as we carry 
the offering, which we administer in 
order to honor the Lord himself and to 
show our eagerness to help. 

20 We want to avoid any criticism of the 
way we administer this liberal gift. 

21 For we are taking pains to do what is 
right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but 
also in the eyes of men. 

22 ln addition, we are sending with them 
our brother who has often proved to us 
in many ways that he is zealous, and 
now even more so because of his great 
confidence in you. 

23 As for Titus, he is my partner and 
fellow worker among you; as for our 



brothers, they are representatives of the 
churches and an honor to Christ. 

24 Therefore show these men the proof of 
your love and the reason for our pride in 
you, so that the churches can see it. 



5/There is no need for me to write to 
you about this service to the saints. 

2 For I know your eagerness to help, and 
I have been boasting about it to the 
Macedonians, telling them that since 
last year you in Achaia were ready to 
give; and your enthusiasm has stirred 
most of them to action. 

3 But I am sending the brothers in order 
that our boasting about you in this 
matter should not prove hollow, but that 
you may be ready, as I said you would 
be. 

4 For if any Macedonians come with me 
and find you unprepared, we-not to say 
anything about you-would be ashamed 
of having been so confident. 

5 So I thought it necessary to urge the 
brothers to visit you in advance and 
finish the arrangements for the 
generous gift you had promised. Then it 
will be ready as a generous gift, not as 
one grudgingly given. 

6 Remember this: Whoever sows 
sparingly will also reap sparingly, and 
whoever sows generously will also reap 
generously. 

7 Each man should give what he has 
decided in his heart to give, not 



reluctantly or under compulsion, for God 
loves a cheerful giver. 

8 And God is able to make all grace 
abound to you, so that in all things at all 
times, having all that you need, you will 
abound in every good work. 

9 As it is written: "He has scattered 
abroad his gifts to the poor; his 
righteousness endures forever." 

10 Now he who supplies seed to the 
sower and bread for food will also 
supply and increase your store of seed 
and will enlarge the harvest of your 
righteousness. 

"You will be made rich in every way so 
that you can be generous on every 
occasion, and through us your 
generosity will result in thanksgiving to 
God. 

12 This service that you perform is not 
only supplying the needs of God's 
people but is also overflowing in many 
expressions of thanks to God. 

13 Because of the service by which you 
have proved yourselves, men will praise 
God for the obedience that 
accompanies your confession of the 
gospel of Christ, and for your generosity 
in sharing with them and with everyone 
else. 

14 And in their prayers for you their 
hearts will go out to you, because of the 
surpassing grace God has given you. 

15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable 
gift! 



10, 



'By the meekness and gentleness 

of Christ, I appeal to you-l, Paul, who 
am "timid" when face to face with you, 
but "bold" when away! 

2 I beg you that when I come I may not 
have to be as bold as I expect to be 
toward some people who think that we 
live by the standards of this world. 

3 For though we live in the world, we do 
not wage war as the world does. 

4 The weapons we fight with are not the 
weapons of the world. On the contrary, 
they have divine power to demolish 
strongholds. 

5 We demolish arguments and every 
pretension that sets itself up against the 
knowledge of God, and we take captive 
every thought to make it obedient to 
Christ. 

6 And we will be ready to punish every 
act of disobedience, once your 
obedience is complete. 

7 You are looking only on the surface of 
things. If anyone is confident that he 
belongs to Christ, he should consider 
again that we belong to Christ just as 
much as he. 

8 For even if I boast somewhat freely 
about the authority the Lord gave us for 
building you up rather than pulling you 
down, I will not be ashamed of it. 

9 I do not want to seem to be trying to 
frighten you with my letters. 



For some say, "His letters are weighty 
and forceful, but in person he is 
unimpressive and his speaking amounts 
to nothing." 

"Such people should realize that what 
we are in our letters when we are 
absent, we will be in our actions when 
we are present. 

12 We do not dare to classify or compare 
ourselves with some who commend 
themselves. When they measure 
themselves by themselves and compare 
themselves with themselves, they are 
not wise. 

13 We, however, will not boast beyond 
proper limits, but will confine our 
boasting to the field God has assigned 
to us, a field that reaches even to you. 

14 We are not going too far in our 
boasting, as would be the case if we 
had not come to you, for we did get as 
far as you with the gospel of Christ. 

15 Neither do we go beyond our limits by 
boasting of work done by others. Our 
hope is that, as your faith continues to 
grow, our area of activity among you will 
greatly expand, 

16 so that we can preach the gospel in 
the regions beyond you. For we do not 
want to boast about work already done 
in another man's territory. 

17 But, "Let him who boasts boast in the 
Lord." 



For it is not the one who commends 
himself who is approved, but the one 
whom the Lord commends. 



11 



I hope you will put up with a little 

of my foolishness; but you are already 
doing that. 

2 I am jealous for you with a godly 
jealousy. I promised you to one husband, 
to Christ, so that I might present you as 
a pure virgin to him. 

3 But I am afraid that just as Eve was 
deceived by the serpent's cunning, your 
minds may somehow be led astray from 
your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 

4 For if someone comes to you and 
preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus 
we preached, or if you receive a 
different spirit from the one you received, 
or a different gospel from the one you 
accepted, you put up with it easily 
enough. 

5 But I do not think I am in the least 
inferior to those "super-apostles." 

6 I may not be a trained speaker, but I do 
have knowledge. We have made this 
perfectly clear to you in every way. 

7 Was it a sin for me to lower myself in 
order to elevate you by preaching the 
gospel of God to you free of charge? 

8 I robbed other churches by receiving 
support from them so as to serve you. 



And when I was with you and needed 
something, I was not a burden to 



anyone, for the brothers who came from 
Macedonia supplied what I needed. I 
have kept myself from being a burden to 
you in any way, and will continue to do 
so. 

10 As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, 
nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop 
this boasting of mine. 

11 Why? Because I do not love you? God 
knows I do! 

12 And I will keep on doing what I am 
doing in order to cut the ground from 
under those who want an opportunity to 
be considered equal with us in the 
things they boast about. 

13 For such men are false apostles, 
deceitful workmen, masquerading as 
apostles of Christ. 

14 And no wonder, for Satan himself 
masquerades as an angel of light. 

15 lt is not surprising, then, if his servants 
masquerade as servants of 
righteousness. Their end will be what 
their actions deserve. 

16 l repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. 
But if you do, then receive me just as 
you would a fool, so that I may do a little 
boasting. 

17 ln this self-confident boasting I am not 
talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. 

18 Since many are boasting in the way 
the world does, I too will boast. 



19 You gladly put up with fools since you 
are so wise! 

20 ln fact, you even put up with anyone 
who enslaves you or exploits you or 
takes advantage of you or pushes 
himself forward or slaps you in the face. 

21 To my shame I admit that we were too 
weak for that! 

22 What anyone else dares to boast 
about-l am speaking as a fool-l also 
dare to boast about. Are they Hebrews? 
So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. 
Are they Abraham's descendants? So 
am I. 

23 Are they servants of Christ? (I am out 
of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I 
have worked much harder, been in 
prison more frequently, been flogged 
more severely, and been exposed to 
death again and again. 

24 Five times I received from the Jews 
the forty lashes minus one. 

25 Three times I was beaten with rods, 
once I was stoned, three times I was 
shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day 
in the open sea, 

26 l have been constantly on the move. I 
have been in danger from rivers, in 
danger from bandits, in danger from my 
own countrymen, in danger from 
Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger 
in the country, in danger at sea; and in 
danger from false brothers. 

27 l have labored and toiled and have 
often gone without sleep; I have known 



hunger and thirst and have often gone 
without food; I have been cold and 
naked. 



was caught up to paradise. He heard 
inexpressible things, things that man is 
not permitted to tell. 



Besides everything else, I face daily 
the pressure of my concern for all the 
churches. 



I will boast about a man like that, but I 
will not boast about myself, except 
about my weaknesses. 



Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? 
Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly 
burn? 

30 lf I must boast, I will boast of the things 
that show my weakness. 

31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, 
who is to be praised forever, knows that 
I am not lying. 

32 ln Damascus the governor under King 
Aretas had the city of the Damascenes 
guarded in order to arrest me. 

33 But I was lowered in a basket from a 
window in the wall and slipped through 
his hands. 



12, 



â–  I must go on boasting. Although 

there is nothing to be gained, I will go on 
to visions and revelations from the Lord. 

2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen 
years ago was caught up to the third 
heaven. Whether it was in the body or 
out of the body I do not know-God 
knows. 

3 And I know that this man-whether in 
the body or apart from the body I do not 
know, but God knows- 



Even if I should choose to boast, I 
would not be a fool, because I would be 
speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no 
one will think more of me than is 
warranted by what I do or say. 

7 To keep me from becoming conceited 
because of these surpassingly great 
revelations, there was given me a thorn 
in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to 
torment me. 

8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to 
take it away from me. 

9 But he said to me, "My grace is 
sufficient for you, for my power is made 
perfect in weakness." Therefore I will 
boast all the more gladly about my 
weaknesses, so that Christ's power may 
rest on me. 

10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight 
in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, 
in persecutions, in difficulties. For when 
I am weak, then I am strong. 

11 1 have made a fool of myself, but you 
drove me to it. I ought to have been 
commended by you, for I am not in the 
least inferior to the "super-apostles," 
even though I am nothing. 



The things that mark an apostle-signs, 
wonders and miracles-were done 
among you with great perseverance. 

13 How were you inferior to the other 
churches, except that I was never a 
burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! 

14 Now I am ready to visit you for the 
third time, and I will not be a burden to 
you, because what I want is not your 
possessions but you. After all, children 
should not have to save up for their 
parents, but parents for their children. 

15 So I will very gladly spend for you 
everything I have and expend myself as 
well. If I love you more, will you love me 
less? 

16 Be that as it may, I have not been a 
burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I 
am, I caught you by trickery! 

17 Did I exploit you through any of the 
men I sent you? 

18 l urged Titus to go to you and I sent 
our brother with him. Titus did not 
exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the 
same spirit and follow the same course? 

19 Have you been thinking all along that 
we have been defending ourselves to 
you? We have been speaking in the 
sight of God as those in Christ; and 
everything we do, dear friends, is for 
your strengthening. 

20 For I am afraid that when I come I may 
not find you as I want you to be, and you 
may not find me as you want me to be. I 
fear that there may be quarreling, 



jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, 
slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder. 

21 1 am afraid that when I come again my 
God will humble me before you, and I 
will be grieved over many who have 
sinned earlier and have not repented of 
the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery 
in which they have indulged. 



13 



â–ºThis will be my third visit to you. 

"Every matter must be established by 
the testimony of two or three witnesses." 

2 I already gave you a warning when I 
was with you the second time. I now 
repeat it while absent: On my return I 
will not spare those who sinned earlier 
or any of the others, 

3 since you are demanding proof that 
Christ is speaking through me. He is not 
weak in dealing with you, but is powerful 
among you. 

4 For to be sure, he was crucified in 
weakness, yet he lives by God's power. 
Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by 
God's power we will live with him to 
serve you. 

5 Examine yourselves to see whether 
you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do 
you not realize that Christ Jesus is in 
you-unless, of course, you fail the test? 

6 And I trust that you will discover that we 
have not failed the test. 

7 Now we pray to God that you will not do 
anything wrong. Not that people will see 
that we have stood the test but that you 



will do what is right even though we may 
seem to have failed. 

8 For we cannot do anything against the 
truth, but only for the truth. 

9 We are glad whenever we are weak but 
you are strong; and our prayer is for 
your perfection. 

10 This is why I write these things when I 
am absent, that when I come I may not 
have to be harsh in my use of authority- 
the authority the Lord gave me for 
building you up, not for tearing you 
down. 



"Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for 
perfection, listen to my appeal, be of 
one mind, live in peace. And the God of 
love and peace will be with you. 

12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. 

13 AII the saints send their greetings. 

14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and the love of God, and the fellowship 
of the Holy Spirit be with you all. 



Galatians 



1 



Paul, an apostle-sent not from men 

nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and 
God the Father, who raised him from the 
dead- 



and all the brothers with me, 
churches in Galatia: 



To the 



Grace and peace to you from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 

4 who gave himself for our sins to rescue 
us from the present evil age, according 
to the will of our God and Father, 

5 to whom be glory for ever and ever. 
Amen. 

6 I am astonished that you are so quickly 
deserting the one who called you by the 
grace of Christ and are turning to a 
different gospel- 

7 which is really no gospel at all. 
Evidently some people are throwing you 
into confusion and are trying to pervert 
the gospel of Christ. 

8 But even if we or an angel from heaven 
should preach a gospel other than the 
one we preached to you, let him be 
eternally condemned! 

9 As we have already said, so now I say 
again: If anybody is preaching to you a 
gospel other than what you accepted, let 
him be eternally condemned! 



10 Am I now trying to win the approval of 
men, or of God? Or am I trying to please 
men? If I were still trying to please men, 
I would not be a servant of Christ. 

11 1 want you to know, brothers, that the 
gospel I preached is not something that 
man made up. 

12 l did not receive it from any man, nor 
was I taught it; rather, I received it by 
revelation from Jesus Christ. 

13 For you have heard of my previous 
way of life in Judaism, how intensely I 
persecuted the church of God and tried 
to destroy it. 

14 l was advancing in Judaism beyond 
many Jews of my own age and was 
extremely zealous for the traditions of 
my fathers. 

15 But when God, who set me apart from 
birth and called me by his grace, was 
pleased 

16 to reveal his Son in me so that I might 
preach him among the Gentiles, I did 
not consult any man, 

17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see 
those who were apostles before I was, 
but I went immediately into Arabia and 
later returned to Damascus. 

18 Then after three years, I went up to 
Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter 
and stayed with him fifteen days. 



19 l saw none of the other apostles-only 
James, the Lord's brother. 

20 l assure you before God that what I 
am writing you is no lie. 

21 Later I went to Syria and Cilicia. 

22 l was personally unknown to the 
churches of Judea that are in Christ. 



They only heard the report: "The man 
who formerly persecuted us is now 
preaching the faith he once tried to 
destroy." 

24 And they praised God because of me. 



fc Fourteen years later I went up again 

to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I 
took Titus along also. 

2 I went in response to a revelation and 
set before them the gospel that I preach 
among the Gentiles. But I did this 
privately to those who seemed to be 
leaders, for fear that I was running or 
had run my race in vain. 

3 Yet not even Titus, who was with me, 
was compelled to be circumcised, even 
though he was a Greek. 

4 This matter arose because some false 
brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy 
on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus 
and to make us slaves. 

5 We did not give in to them for a 
moment, so that the truth of the gospel 
might remain with you. 



As for those who seemed to be 
important-whatever they were makes 
no difference to me; God does not judge 
by external appearance-those men 
added nothing to my message. 

7 On the contrary, they saw that I had 
been entrusted with the task of 
preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, 
just as Peter had been to the Jews. 

8 For God, who was at work in the 
ministry of Peter as an apostle to the 
Jews, was also at work in my ministry as 
an apostle to the Gentiles. 

9 James, Peter and John, those reputed 
to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the 
right hand of fellowship when they 
recognized the grace given to me. They 
agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, 
and they to the Jews. 

10 AII they asked was that we should 
continue to remember the poor, the very 
thing I was eager to do. 

"When Peter came to Antioch, I 
opposed him to his face, because he 
was clearly in the wrong. 

12 Before certain men came from James, 
he used to eat with the Gentiles. But 
when they arrived, he began to draw 
back and separate himself from the 
Gentiles because he was afraid of those 
who belonged to the circumcision group. 

13 The other Jews joined him in his 
hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy 
even Barnabas was led astray. 



14 When I saw that they were not acting 
in line with the truth of the gospel, I said 
to Peter in front of them all, "You are a 
Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not 
like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force 
Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? 

15 "We who are Jews by birth and not 
'Gentile sinners' 

16 know that a man is not justified by 
observing the law, but by faith in Jesus 
Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in 
Christ Jesus that we may be justified by 
faith in Christ and not by observing the 
law, because by observing the law no 
one will be justified. 

17 "lf, while we seek to be justified in 
Christ, it becomes evident that we 
ourselves are sinners, does that mean 
that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! 

18 lf I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove 
that I am a lawbreaker. 

19 For through the law I died to the law so 
that I might live for God. 

20 l have been crucified with Christ and I 
no longer live, but Christ lives in me. 
The life I live in the body, I live by faith in 
the Son of God, who loved me and gave 
himself for me. 

21 1 do not set aside the grace of God, for 
if righteousness could be gained 
through the law, Christ died for nothing!" 



OYou foolish Galatians! Who has 
bewitched you? Before your very eyes 



Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as 
crucified. 

2 I would like to learn just one thing from 
you: Did you receive the Spirit by 
observing the law, or by believing what 
you heard? 

3 Are you so foolish? After beginning with 
the Spirit, are you now trying to attain 
your goal by human effort? 

4 Have you suffered so much for nothing- 
-if it really was for nothing? 

5 Does God give you his Spirit and work 
miracles among you because you 
observe the law, or because you believe 
what you heard? 

6 Consider Abraham: "He believed God, 
and it was credited to him as 
righteousness." 

Understand, then, that those who 
believe are children of Abraham. 

8 The Scripture foresaw that God would 
justify the Gentiles by faith, and 
announced the gospel in advance to 
Abraham: "All nations will be blessed 
through you." 

9 So those who have faith are blessed 
along with Abraham, the man of faith. 

10 AII who rely on observing the law are 
under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is 
everyone who does not continue to do 
everything written in the Book of the 
Law." 



"Clearly no one is justified before God 
by the law, because, "The righteous will 
live by faith." 

12 The law is not based on faith; on the 
contrary, "The man who does these 
things will live by them." 

13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of 
the law by becoming a curse for us, for it 
is written: "Cursed is everyone who is 
hung on a tree." 

14 He redeemed us in order that the 
blessing given to Abraham might come 
to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so 
that by faith we might receive the 
promise of the Spirit. 

15 Brothers, let me take an example from 
everyday life. Just as no one can set 
aside or add to a human covenant that 
has been duly established, so it is in this 
case. 

16 The promises were spoken to 
Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture 
does not say "and to seeds," meaning 
many people, but "and to your seed," 
meaning one person, who is Christ. 

17 What I mean is this: The law, 
introduced 430 years later, does not set 
aside the covenant previously 
established by God and thus do away 
with the promise. 

18 For if the inheritance depends on the 
law, then it no longer depends on a 
promise; but God in his grace gave it to 
Abraham through a promise. 



What, then, was the purpose of the 
law? It was added because of 
transgressions until the Seed to whom 
the promise referred had come. The law 
was put into effect through angels by a 
mediator. 

20 A mediator, however, does not 
represent just one party; but God is one. 

21 Is the law, therefore, opposed to the 
promises of God? Absolutely not! For if 
a law had been given that could impart 
life, then righteousness would certainly 
have come by the law. 

22 But the Scripture declares that the 
whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that 
what was promised, being given through 
faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to 
those who believe. 

23 Before this faith came, we were held 
prisoners by the law, locked up until 
faith should be revealed. 

24 So the law was put in charge to lead 
us to Christ that we might be justified by 
faith. 

25 Now that faith has come, we are no 
longer under the supervision of the law. 

26 You are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus, 

27 for all of you who were baptized into 
Christ have clothed yourselves with 
Christ. 

28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave 
nor free, male nor female, for you are all 
one in Christ Jesus. 



29 lf you belong to Christ, then you are 
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to 
the promise. 



tWhat I am saying is that as long as 

the heir is a child, he is no different from 
a slave, although he owns the whole 
estate. 



10 You are observing special days and 
months and seasons and years! 

11 l fear for you, that somehow I have 
wasted my efforts on you. 

12 l plead with you, brothers, become like 
me, for I became like you. You have 
done me no wrong. 



He is subject to guardians and trustees 
until the time set by his father. 

3 So also, when we were children, we 
were in slavery under the basic 
principles of the world. 

4 But when the time had fully come, God 
sent his Son, born of a woman, born 
under law, 

5 to redeem those under law, that we 
might receive the full rights of sons. 

6 Because you are sons, God sent the 
Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the 
Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father." 

7 So you are no longer a slave, but a 
son; and since you are a son, God has 
made you also an heir. 

8 Formerly, when you did not know God, 
you were slaves to those who by nature 
are not gods. 

9 But now that you know God-or rather 
are known by God-how is it that you are 
turning back to those weak and 
miserable principles? Do you wish to be 
enslaved by them all over again? 



As you know, it was because of an 
illness that I first preached the gospel to 
you. 

14 Even though my illness was a trial to 
you, you did not treat me with contempt 
or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as 
if I were an angel of God, as if I were 
Christ Jesus himself. 

15 What has happened to all your joy? I 
can testify that, if you could have done 
so, you would have torn out your eyes 
and given them to me. 

16 Have I now become your enemy by 
telling you the truth? 

17 Those people are zealous to win you 
over, but for no good. What they want is 
to alienate you from us, so that you may 
be zealous for them. 

18 lt is fine to be zealous, provided the 
purpose is good, and to be so always 
and not just when I am with you. 

19 My dear children, for whom I am again 
in the pains of childbirth until Christ is 
formed in you, 



20 how I wish I could be with you now 
and change my tone, because I am 
perplexed about you! 

21 Tell me, you who want to be under the 
law, are you not aware of what the law 
says? 

22 For it is written that Abraham had two 
sons, one by the slave woman and the 
other by the free woman. 

23 His son by the slave woman was born 
in the ordinary way; but his son by the 
free woman was born as the result of a 
promise. 

24 These things may be taken figuratively, 
for the women represent two covenants. 
One covenant is from Mount Sinai and 
bears children who are to be slaves: 
This is Hagar. 

25 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in 
Arabia and corresponds to the present 
city of Jerusalem, because she is in 
slavery with her children. 

26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, 
and she is our mother. 

27 For it is written: "Be glad, O barren 
woman, who bears no children; break 
forth and cry aloud, you who have no 
labor pains; because more are the 
children of the desolate woman than of 
her who has a husband." 

28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are 
children of promise. 

29 At that time the son born in the 
ordinary way persecuted the son born 



by the power of the Spirit. It is the 
now. 



same 



30 But what does the Scripture say? "Get 
rid of the slave woman and her son, for 
the slave woman's son will never share 
in the inheritance with the free woman's 
son." 

31 Therefore, brothers, we are not 
children of the slave woman, but of the 
free woman. 



^It is for freedom that Christ has set us 

free. Stand firm, then, and do not let 
yourselves be burdened again by a yoke 
of slavery. 

2 Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if 
you let yourselves be circumcised, 
Christ will be of no value to you at all. 

3 Again I declare to every man who lets 
himself be circumcised that he is 
obligated to obey the whole law. 

4 You who are trying to be justified by law 
have been alienated from Christ; you 
have fallen away from grace. 

5 But by faith we eagerly await through 
the Spirit the righteousness for which we 
hope. 

6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision 
nor uncircumcision has any value. The 
only thing that counts is faith expressing 
itself through love. 

7 You were running a good race. Who cut 
in on you and kept you from obeying the 
truth? 



8 That kind of persuasion does not come 
from the one who calls you. 

9 "A little yeast works through the whole 
batch of dough." 

10 l am confident in the Lord that you will 
take no other view. The one who is 
throwing you into confusion will pay the 
penalty, whoever he may be. 

"Brothers, if I am still preaching 
circumcision, why am I still being 
persecuted? In that case the offense of 
the cross has been abolished. 



18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are 
not under law. 

19 The acts of the sinful nature are 
obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and 
debauchery; 

20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, 
jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, 
dissensions, factions 

21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and 
the like. I warn you, as I did before, that 
those who live like this will not inherit the 
kingdom of God. 



As for those agitators, I wish they 
would go the whole way and emasculate 
themselves! 



But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, 
peace, patience, kindness, goodness, 
faithfulness, 



You, my brothers, were called to be 
free. But do not use your freedom to 
indulge the sinful nature ; rather, serve 
one another in love. 

14 The entire law is summed up in a 
single command: "Love your neighbor 
as yourself." 

15 lf you keep on biting and devouring 
each other, watch out or you will be 
destroyed by each other. 

16 So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will 
not gratify the desires of the sinful 
nature. 

17 For the sinful nature desires what is 
contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what 
is contrary to the sinful nature. They are 
in conflict with each other, so that you 
do not do what you want. 



23 gentleness and self-control. Against 
such things there is no law. 

24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus 
have crucified the sinful nature with its 
passions and desires. 

25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep 
in step with the Spirit. 



26 Let us not become conceited, 
provoking and envying each other. 



wBrothers, if someone is caught in a 

sin, you who are spiritual should restore 
him gently. But watch yourself, or you 
also may be tempted. 

2 Carry each other's burdens, and in this 
way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 



3 lf anyone thinks he is something when 
he is nothing, he deceives himself. 



11 See what large letters I use as I write 
to you with my own hand! 



Each one should test his own actions. 
Then he can take pride in himself, 
without comparing himself to somebody 
else, 

5 for each one should carry his own load. 

6 Anyone who receives instruction in the 
word must share all good things with his 
instructor. 



Those who want to make a good 
impression outwardly are trying to 
compel you to be circumcised. The only 
reason they do this is to avoid being 
persecuted for the cross of Christ. 

13 Not even those who are circumcised 
obey the law, yet they want you to be 
circumcised that they may boast about 
your flesh. 



Do not be deceived: God cannot be 
mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 

8 The one who sows to please his sinful 
nature, from that nature will reap 
destruction; the one who sows to please 
the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap 
eternal life. 



May I never boast except in the cross 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which 
the world has been crucified to me, and 
I to the world. 

15 Neither circumcision nor 

uncircumcision means anything; what 
counts is a new creation. 



9 Let us not become weary in doing good, 
for at the proper time we will reap a 
harvest if we do not give up. 

10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let 
us do good to all people, especially to 
those who belong to the family of 
believers. 



Peace and mercy to all who follow this 
rule, even to the Israel of God. 

17 Finally, let no one cause me trouble, 
for I bear on my body the marks of 
Jesus. 

18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with your spirit, brothers. Amen. 



Ephesians 



1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by 

the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, 
the faithful in Christ Jesus: 

2 Grace and peace to you from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

3 Praise be to the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us 
in the heavenly realms with every 
spiritual blessing in Christ. 



For he chose us in him before the 
creation of the world to be holy and 
blameless in his sight. In love 

5 he predestined us to be adopted as his 
sons through Jesus Christ, in 
accordance with his pleasure and will- 

6 to the praise of his glorious grace, 
which he has freely given us in the One 
he loves. 

'In him we have redemption through his 
blood, the forgiveness of sins, in 
accordance with the riches of God's 
grace 

8 that he lavished on us with all wisdom 
and understanding. 

9 And he made known to us the mystery 
of his will according to his good pleasure, 
which he purposed in Christ, 



10 to be put into effect when the times will 
have reached their fulfillment-to bring 
all things in heaven and on earth 
together under one head, even Christ. 

11 ln him we were also chosen, having 
been predestined according to the plan 
of him who works out everything in 
conformity with the purpose of his will, 

12 in order that we, who were the first to 
hope in Christ, might be for the praise of 
his glory. 

13 And you also were included in Christ 
when you heard the word of truth, the 
gospel of your salvation. Having 
believed, you were marked in him with a 
seal, the promised Holy Spirit, 

14 who is a deposit guaranteeing our 
inheritance until the redemption of those 
who are God's possession-to the praise 
of his glory. 

15 For this reason, ever since I heard 
about your faith in the Lord Jesus and 
your love for all the saints, 

16 l have not stopped giving thanks for 
you, remembering you in my prayers. 

17 l keep asking that the God of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may 
give you the Spirit of wisdom and 
revelation, so that you may know him 
better. 

18 l pray also that the eyes of your heart 
may be enlightened in order that you 



may know the hope to which he has 
called you, the riches of his glorious 
inheritance in the saints, 



made us alive with Christ even when 
we were dead in transgressions-it is by 
grace you have been saved. 



19 and his incomparably great power for 
us who believe. That power is like the 
working of his mighty strength, 

20 which he exerted in Christ when he 
raised him from the dead and seated 
him at his right hand in the heavenly 
realms, 

21 far above all rule and authority, power 
and dominion, and every title that can 
be given, not only in the present age but 
also in the one to come. 

22 And God placed all things under his 
feet and appointed him to be head over 
everything for the church, 

23 which is his body, the fullness of him 
who fills everything in every way. 



^As for you, you were dead in your 
transgressions and sins, 

2 in which you used to live when you 
followed the ways of this world and of 
the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the 
spirit who is now at work in those who 
are disobedient. 

3 AII of us also lived among them at one 
time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful 
nature and following its desires and 
thoughts. Like the rest, we were by 
nature objects of wrath. 

4 But because of his great love for us, 
God, who is rich in mercy, 



And God raised us up with Christ and 
seated us with him in the heavenly 
realms in Christ Jesus, 

7 in order that in the coming ages he 
might show the incomparable riches of 
his grace, expressed in his kindness to 
us in Christ Jesus. 

8 For it is by grace you have been saved, 
through faith-and this not from 
yourselves, it is the gift of God- 

9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 

10 For we are God's workmanship, 
created in Christ Jesus to do good 
works, which God prepared in advance 
for us to do. 

^Therefore, remember that formerly you 
who are Gentiles by birth and called 
"uncircumcised" by those who call 
themselves "the circumcision" (that done 
in the body by the hands of men)- 

12 remember that at that time you were 
separate from Christ, excluded from 
citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the 
covenants of the promise, without hope 
and without God in the world. 

13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once 
were far away have been brought near 
through the blood of Christ. 

14 For he himself is our peace, who has 
made the two one and has destroyed 
the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 



by abolishing in his flesh the law with 
its commandments and regulations. His 
purpose was to create in himself one 
new man out of the two, thus making 
peace, 

16 and in this one body to reconcile both 
of them to God through the cross, by 
which he put to death their hostility. 

17 He came and preached peace to you 
who were far away and peace to those 
who were near. 

18 For through him we both have access 
to the Father by one Spirit. 

^Consequently, you are no longer 
foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens 
with God's people and members of 
God's household, 

20 built on the foundation of the apostles 
and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself 
as the chief cornerstone. 

21 ln him the whole building is joined 
together and rises to become a holy 
temple in the Lord. 

22 And in him you too are being built 
together to become a dwelling in which 
God lives by his Spirit. 



OFor this reason I, Paul, the prisoner 

of Christ Jesus for the sake of you 
Gentiles- 

2 Surely you have heard about the 
administration of God's grace that was 
given to me for you, 



that is, the mystery made known to me 
by revelation, as I have already written 
briefly. 

4 ln reading this, then, you will be able to 
understand my insight into the mystery 
of Christ, 

5 which was not made known to men in 
other generations as it has now been 
revealed by the Spirit to God's holy 
apostles and prophets. 

6 This mystery is that through the gospel 
the Gentiles are heirs together with 
Israel, members together of one body, 
and sharers together in the promise in 
Christ Jesus. 

7 I became a servant of this gospel by 
the gift of God's grace given me through 
the working of his power. 

8 Although I am less than the least of all 
God's people, this grace was given me: 
to preach to the Gentiles the 
unsearchable riches of Christ, 

9 and to make plain to everyone the 
administration of this mystery, which for 
ages past was kept hidden in God, who 
created all things. 

10 His intent was that now, through the 
church, the manifold wisdom of God 
should be made known to the rulers and 
authorities in the heavenly realms, 

"according to his eternal purpose which 
he accomplished in Christ Jesus our 
Lord. 



In him and through faith in him we may 
approach God with freedom and 
confidence. 

13 l ask you, therefore, not to be 
discouraged because of my sufferings 
for you, which are your glory. 

14 For this reason I kneel before the 
Father, 

15 from whom his whole family in heaven 
and on earth derives its name. 

16 l pray that out of his glorious riches he 
may strengthen you with power through 
his Spirit in your inner being, 

17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts 
through faith. And I pray that you, being 
rooted and established in love, 

18 may have power, together with all the 
saints, to grasp how wide and long and 
high and deep is the love of Christ, 

19 and to know this love that surpasses 
knowledge-that you may be filled to the 
measure of all the fullness of God. 

20 Now to him who is able to do 
immeasurably more than all we ask or 
imagine, according to his power that is 
at work within us, 

21 to him be glory in the church and in 
Christ Jesus throughout all generations, 
for ever and ever! Amen. 



tAs a prisoner for the Lord, then, I 

urge you to live a life worthy of the 
calling you have received. 

2 Be completely humble and gentle; be 
patient, bearing with one another in love. 

3 Make every effort to keep the unity of 
the Spirit through the bond of peace. 

4 There is one body and one Spiritâ€” just 
as you were called to one hope when 
you were called- 

5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 

6 one God and Father of all, who is over 
all and through all and in all. 

7 But to each one of us grace has been 
given as Christ apportioned it. 

8 This is why it says: "When he ascended 
on high, he led captives in his train and 
gave gifts to men." 

9 (What does "he ascended" mean 
except that he also descended to the 
lower, earthly regions ? 

10 He who descended is the very one 
who ascended higher than all the 
heavens, in order to fill the whole 
universe.) 



It was he who gave some to be 
apostles, some to be prophets, some to 
be evangelists, and some to be pastors 
and teachers, 



12 to prepare God's people for works of 
service, so that the body of Christ may 
be built up 



21 Surely you heard of him and were 
taught in him in accordance with the 
truth that is in Jesus. 



until we all reach unity in the faith and 
in the knowledge of the Son of God and 
become mature, attaining to the whole 
measure of the fullness of Christ. 



22 You were taught, with regard to your 
former way of life, to put off your old self, 
which is being corrupted by its deceitful 
desires; 



Then we will no longer be infants, 
tossed back and forth by the waves, and 
blown here and there by every wind of 
teaching and by the cunning and 
craftiness of men in their deceitful 
scheming. 

15 lnstead, speaking the truth in love, we 
will in all things grow up into him who is 
the Head, that is, Christ. 

16 From him the whole body, joined and 
held together by every supporting 
ligament, grows and builds itself up in 
love, as each part does its work. 

17 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the 
Lord, that you must no longer live as the 
Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 

18 They are darkened in their 
understanding and separated from the 
life of God because of the ignorance 
that is in them due to the hardening of 
their hearts. 

19 Having lost all sensitivity, they have 
given themselves over to sensuality so 
as to indulge in every kind of impurity, 
with a continual lust for more. 

20 You, however, did not come to know 
Christ that way. 



to be made new in the attitude of your 
minds; 

24 and to put on the new self, created to 
be like God in true righteousness and 
holiness. 

25 Therefore each of you must put off 
falsehood and speak truthfully to his 
neighbor, for we are all members of one 
body. 

26 "ln your anger do not sin" : Do not let 
the sun go down while you are still 
angry, 

27 and do not give the devil a foothold. 

28 He who has been stealing must steal 
no longer, but must work, doing 
something useful with his own hands, 
that he may have something to share 
with those in need. 

29 Do not let any unwholesome talk come 
out of your mouths, but only what is 
helpful for building others up according 
to their needs, that it may benefit those 
who listen. 

30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of 
God, with whom you were sealed for the 
day of redemption. 



31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage and 
anger, brawling and slander, along with 
every form of malice. 



32 



Be kind and compassionate to one 
another, forgiving each other, just as in 
Christ God forgave you. 



(for the fruit of the light consists in all 
goodness, righteousness and truth) 

10 and find out what pleases the Lord. 

"Have nothing to do with the fruitless 
deeds of darkness, but rather expose 
them. 



^Be imitators of God, therefore, as 
dearly loved children 

2 and live a life of love, just as Christ 
loved us and gave himself up for us as a 
fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. 

3 But among you there must not be even 
a hint of sexual immorality, or of any 
kind of impurity, or of greed, because 
these are improper for God's holy 
people. 

4 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish 
talk or coarse joking, which are out of 
place, but rather thanksgiving. 

5 For of this you can be sure: No immoral, 
impure or greedy person-such a man is 
an idolater-has any inheritance in the 
kingdom of Christ and of God. 

6 Let no one deceive you with empty 
words, for because of such things God's 
wrath comes on those who are 
disobedient. 

therefore do not be partners with them. 

8 For you were once darkness, but now 
you are light in the Lord. Live as children 
of light 



For it is shameful even to mention 
what the disobedient do in secret. 

13 But everything exposed by the light 
becomes visible, 

14 for it is light that makes everything 
visible. This is why it is said: "Wake up, 



O sleeper, rise from the dead, 
Christ will shine on you." 



and 



15 Be very careful, then, how you live- 
not as unwise but as wise, 

16 making the most of every opportunity, 
because the days are evil. 

17 Therefore do not be foolish, but 
understand what the Lord's will is. 

18 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads 
to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the 
Spirit. 

19 Speak to one another with psalms, 
hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and 
make music in your heart to the Lord, 

20 always giving thanks to God the 
Father for everything, in the name of our 
Lord Jesus Christ. 



Submit to one another out of 
reverence for Christ. 

22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to 
the Lord. 

23 For the husband is the head of the 
wife as Christ is the head of the church, 
his body, of which he is the Savior. 

24 Now as the church submits to Christ, 
so also wives should submit to their 
husbands in everything. 

25 Husbands, love your wives, just as 
Christ loved the church and gave 
himself up for her 

26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the 
washing with water through the word, 

27 and to present her to himself as a 
radiant church, without stain or wrinkle 
or any other blemish, but holy and 
blameless. 

28 ln this same way, husbands ought to 
love their wives as their own bodies. He 
who loves his wife loves himself. 

29 After all, no one ever hated his own 
body, but he feeds and cares for it, just 
as Christ does the church- 



30. 



for we are members of his body. 



31 



"For this reason a man will leave his 
father and mother and be united to his 
wife, and the two will become one flesh." 



However, each one of you also must 
love his wife as he loves himself, and 
the wife must respect her husband. 



WChildren, obey your parents in the 
Lord, for this is right. 

2 "Honor your father and mother"-which 
is the first commandment with a 
promise- 

3 "that it may go well with you and that 
you may enjoy long life on the earth." 

4 Fathers, do not exasperate your 
children; instead, bring them up in the 
training and instruction of the Lord. 

5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with 
respect and fear, and with sincerity of 
heart, just as you would obey Christ. 

6 Obey them not only to win their favor 
when their eye is on you, but like slaves 
of Christ, doing the will of God from your 
heart. 

7 Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were 
serving the Lord, not men, 

8 because you know that the Lord will 
reward everyone for whatever good he 
does, whether he is slave or free. 

9 And masters, treat your slaves in the 
same way. Do not threaten them, since 
you know that he who is both their 
Master and yours is in heaven, and 
there is no favoritism with him. 



32- 



This is a profound mystery-but I am 
talking about Christ and the church. 



10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his 
mighty power. 

11 Put on the full armor of God so that 
you can take your stand against the 
devil's schemes. 

12 For our struggle is not against flesh 
and blood, but against the rulers, 
against the authorities, against the 
powers of this dark world and against 
the spiritual forces of evil in the 
heavenly realms. 



Take the helmet of salvation and the 
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of 
God. 

18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions 
with all kinds of prayers and requests. 
With this in mind, be alert and always 
keep on praying for all the saints. 

19 Pray also for me, that whenever I open 
my mouth, words may be given me so 
that I will fearlessly make known the 
mystery of the gospel, 



13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, 
so that when the day of evil comes, you 
may be able to stand your ground, and 
after you have done everything, to stand. 

14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth 
buckled around your waist, with the 
breastplate of righteousness in place, 



for which I am an ambassador in 
chains. Pray that I may declare it 
fearlessly, as I should. 

21 Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful 
servant in the Lord, will tell you 
everything, so that you also may know 
how I am and what I am doing. 



and with your feet fitted with the 
readiness that comes from the gospel of 
peace. 

16 ln addition to all this, take up the shield 
of faith, with which you can extinguish 
all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 



22 l am sending him to you for this very 
purpose, that you may know how we are, 
and that he may encourage you. 

23 Peace to the brothers, and love with 
faith from God the Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 



Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus 
Christ with an undying love. 



Philippians 



1 



Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ 

Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus 
at Philippi, together with the overseers 
and deacons: 

2 Grace and peace to you from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

3 I thank my God every time I remember 
you. 

4 ln all my prayers for all of you, I always 
pray with joy 



5 because of your partnership in 
gospel from the first day until now, 



the 



being confident of this, that he who 
began a good work in you will carry it on 
to completion until the day of Christ 
Jesus. 

7 lt is right for me to feel this way about 
all of you, since I have you in my heart; 
for whether I am in chains or defending 
and confirming the gospel, all of you 
share in God's grace with me. 

8 God can testify how I long for all of you 
with the affection of Christ Jesus. 

9 And this is my prayer: that your love 
may abound more and more in 
knowledge and depth of insight, 



10 so that you may be able to discern 
what is best and may be pure and 
blameless until the day of Christ, 

"filled with the fruit of righteousness 
that comes through Jesus Christâ€” to the 
glory and praise of God. 

12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that 
what has happened to me has really 
served to advance the gospel. 

13 As a result, it has become clear 
throughout the whole palace guard and 
to everyone else that I am in chains for 
Christ. 

14 Because of my chains, most of the 
brothers in the Lord have been 
encouraged to speak the word of God 
more courageously and fearlessly. 

15 lt is true that some preach Christ out of 
envy and rivalry, but others out of 
goodwill. 

16 The latter do so in love, knowing that I 
am put here for the defense of the 
gospel. 

17 The former preach Christ out of selfish 
ambition, not sincerely, supposing that 
they can stir up trouble for me while I 
am in chains. 

18 But what does it matter? The important 
thing is that in every way, whether from 
false motives or true, Christ is preached. 
And because of this I rejoice. 



Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, for I 
know that through your prayers and the 
help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
what has happened to me will turn out 
for my deliverance. 

20 l eagerly expect and hope that I will in 
no way be ashamed, but will have 
sufficient courage so that now as always 
Christ will be exalted in my body, 
whether by life or by death. 

21 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is 
gain. 

22 lf I am to go on living in the body, this 
will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what 
shall I choose? I do not know! 

23 l am torn between the two: I desire to 
depart and be with Christ, which is 
better by far; 

24 but it is more necessary for you that I 
remain in the body. 

25 Convinced of this, I know that I will 
remain, and I will continue with all of you 
for your progress and joy in the faith, 

26 so that through my being with you 
again your joy in Christ Jesus will 
overflow on account of me. 

27 Whatever happens, conduct 

yourselves in a manner worthy of the 
gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come 
and see you or only hear about you in 
my absence, I will know that you stand 
firm in one spirit, contending as one 
man for the faith of the gospel 



28 without being frightened in any way by 
those who oppose you. This is a sign to 
them that they will be destroyed, but that 
you will be saved-and that by God. 

29 For it has been granted to you on 
behalf of Christ not only to believe on 
him, but also to suffer for him, 

30 since you are going through the same 
struggle you saw I had, and now hear 
that I still have. 



^If you have any encouragement from 

being united with Christ, if any comfort 
from his love, if any fellowship with the 
Spirit, if any tenderness and 
compassion, 

2 then make my joy complete by being 
like-minded, having the same love, 
being one in spirit and purpose. 

3 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or 
vain conceit, but in humility consider 
others better than yourselves. 

4 Each of you should look not only to 
your own interests, but also to the 
interests of others. 

5 Your attitude should be the same as 
that of Christ Jesus: 

6 Who, being in very nature God, did not 
consider equality with God something to 
be grasped, 

7 but made himself nothing, taking the 
very nature of a servant, being made in 
human likeness. 



And being found in appearance as a 
man, he humbled himself and became 
obedient to death-- even death on a 
cross! 

therefore God exalted him to the 
highest place and gave him the name 
that is above every name, 

10 that at the name of Jesus every knee 
should bow, in heaven and on earth and 
under the earth, 

"and every tongue confess that Jesus 
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the 
Father. 

12 Therefore, my dear friends, as you 
have always obeyed-not only in my 
presence, but now much more in my 
absence-continue to work out your 
salvation with fear and trembling, 

13 for it is God who works in you to will 
and to act according to his good 
purpose. 

14 Do everything without complaining or 
arguing, 

15 so that you may become blameless 
and pure, children of God without fault in 
a crooked and depraved generation, in 
which you shine like stars in the 
universe 

16 as you hold out the word of life â€” in 
order that I may boast on the day of 
Christ that I did not run or labor for 
nothing. 

17 But even if I am being poured out like 
a drink offering on the sacrifice and 



service coming from your faith, I 
glad and rejoice with all of you. 



am 



18 So you too should be glad and rejoice 
with me. 

19 l hope in the Lord Jesus to send 
Timothy to you soon, that I also may be 
cheered when I receive news about you. 

20 l have no one else like him, who takes 
a genuine interest in your welfare. 

21 For everyone looks out for his own 
interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 

22 But you know that Timothy has proved 
himself, because as a son with his 
father he has served with me in the work 
of the gospel. 

23 l hope, therefore, to send him as soon 
as I see how things go with me. 

24 And I am confident in the Lord that I 
myself will come soon. 

25 But I think it is necessary to send back 
to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow 
worker and fellow soldier, who is also 
your messenger, whom you sent to take 
care of my needs. 

26 For he longs for all of you and is 
distressed because you heard he was ill. 

27 lndeed he was ill, and almost died. But 
God had mercy on him, and not on him 
only but also on me, to spare me sorrow 
upon sorrow. 

28 Therefore I am all the more eager to 
send him, so that when you see him 



again you may be glad and I may have 
less anxiety. 

29 Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, 
and honor men like him, 

30 because he almost died for the work of 
Christ, risking his life to make up for the 
help you could not give me. 



greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my 
Lord, for whose sake I have lost all 
things. I consider them rubbish, that I 
may gain Christ 

9 and be found in him, not having a 
righteousness of my own that comes 
from the law, but that which is through 
faith in Christâ€” the righteousness that 
comes from God and is by faith. 



O Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the 

Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the 
same things to you again, and it is a 
safeguard for you. 

2 Watch out for those dogs, those men 
who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh. 

3 For it is we who are the circumcision, 
we who worship by the Spirit of God, 
who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put 
no confidence in the flesh- 
chough I myself have reasons for such 
confidence. 

5 lf anyone else thinks he has reasons to 
put confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
circumcised on the eighth day, of the 
people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, 
a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the 
law, a Pharisee; 

6 as for zeal, persecuting the church; as 
for legalistic righteousness, faultless. 

7 But whatever was to my profit I now 
consider loss for the sake of Christ. 

8 What is more, I consider everything a 
loss compared to the surpassing 



10 l want to know Christ and the power of 
his resurrection and the fellowship of 
sharing in his sufferings, becoming like 
him in his death, 

"and so, somehow, to attain to the 
resurrection from the dead. 

12 Not that I have already obtained all 
this, or have already been made perfect, 
but I press on to take hold of that for 
which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 

13 Brothers, I do not consider myself yet 
to have taken hold of it. But one thing I 
do: Forgetting what is behind and 
straining toward what is ahead, 

14 l press on toward the goal to win the 
prize for which God has called me 
heavenward in Christ Jesus. 

15 AII of us who are mature should take 
such a view of things. And if on some 
point you think differently, that too God 
will make clear to you. 

16 Only let us live up to what we have 
already attained. 

17 Join with others in following my 
example, brothers, and take note of 



those who live according to the pattern 
we gave you. 



Let your gentleness be evident to all. 
The Lord is near. 



For, as I have often told you before 
and now say again even with tears, 
many live as enemies of the cross of 
Christ. 



Do not be anxious about anything, but 
in everything, by prayer and petition, 
with thanksgiving, present your requests 
to God. 



19 Their destiny is destruction, their god 
is their stomach, and their glory is in 
their shame. Their mind is on earthly 
things. 



7 And the peace of God, which 
transcends all understanding, will guard 
your hearts and your minds in Christ 
Jesus. 



But our citizenship is in heaven. And 
we eagerly await a Savior from there, 
the Lord Jesus Christ, 

21 who, by the power that enables him to 
bring everything under his control, will 
transform our lowly bodies so that they 
will be like his glorious body. 



^â™¦Therefore, my brothers, you whom I 

love and long for, my joy and crown, that 
is how you should stand firm in the Lord, 
dear friends! 

2 I plead with Euodia and I plead with 
Syntyche to agree with each other in the 
Lord. 

3 Yes, and I ask you, loyal yokefellow, 
help these women who have contended 
at my side in the cause of the gospel, 
along with Clement and the rest of my 
fellow workers, whose names are in the 
book of life. 

4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it 
again: Rejoice! 



Finally, brothers, whatever is true, 
whatever is noble, whatever is right, 
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, 
whatever is admirable-if anything is 
excellent or praiseworthy-think about 
such things. 

9 Whatever you have learned or received 
or heard from me, or seen in me-put it 
into practice. And the God of peace will 
be with you. 

10 l rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last 
you have renewed your concern for me. 
Indeed, you have been concerned, but 
you had no opportunity to show it. 

11 l am not saying this because I am in 
need, for I have learned to be content 
whatever the circumstances. 

12 l know what it is to be in need, and I 
know what it is to have plenty. I have 
learned the secret of being content in 
any and every situation, whether well 
fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or 
in want. 

13 l can do everything through him who 
gives me strength. 



14 Yet it was good of you to share in my 
troubles. 

15 Moreover, as you Philippians know, in 
the early days of your acquaintance with 
the gospel, when I set out from 
Macedonia, not one church shared with 
me in the matter of giving and receiving, 
except you only; 

16 for even when I was in Thessalonica, 
you sent me aid again and again when I 
was in need. 

17 Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am 
looking for what may be credited to your 
account. 

18 l have received full payment and even 
more; I am amply supplied, now that I 
have received from Epaphroditus the 



gifts you sent. They are a fragrant 
offering, an acceptable sacrifice, 
pleasing to God. 

19 And my God will meet all your needs 
according to his glorious riches in Christ 
Jesus. 

20 To our God and Father be glory for 
ever and ever. Amen. 

21 Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. 
The brothers who are with me send 
greetings. 

22 AII the saints send you greetings, 
especially those who belong to Caesar's 
household. 

23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be 
with your spirit. Amen. 



Colossians 



1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by 
the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 

2 To the holy and faithful brothers in 
Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to 
you from God our Father. 

3 We always thank God, the Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for 
you, 

4 because we have heard of your faith in 
Christ Jesus and of the love you have 
for all the saints- 

5 the faith and love that spring from the 
hope that is stored up for you in heaven 
and that you have already heard about 
in the word of truth, the gospel 

6 that has come to you. All over the world 
this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, 
just as it has been doing among you 
since the day you heard it and 
understood God's grace in all its truth. 

'You learned it from Epaphras, our dear 
fellow servant, who is a faithful minister 
of Christ on our behalf, 

8 and who also told us of your love in the 
Spirit. 

9 For this reason, since the day we heard 
about you, we have not stopped praying 
for you and asking God to fill you with 



the knowledge of his will through all 
spiritual wisdom and understanding. 

10 And we pray this in order that you may 
live a life worthy of the Lord and may 
please him in every way: bearing fruit in 
every good work, growing in the 
knowledge of God, 

"being strengthened with all power 
according to his glorious might so that 
you may have great endurance and 
patience, and joyfully 

12 giving thanks to the Father, who has 
qualified you to share in the inheritance 
of the saints in the kingdom of light. 

13 For he has rescued us from the 
dominion of darkness and brought us 
into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 

14 in whom we have redemption, the 
forgiveness of sins. 

15 He is the image of the invisible God, 
the firstborn over all creation. 

16 For by him all things were created: 
things in heaven and on earth, visible 
and invisible, whether thrones or powers 
or rulers or authorities; all things were 
created by him and for him. 

17 He is before all things, and in him all 
things hold together. 

18 And he is the head of the body, the 
church; he is the beginning and the 



firstborn from among the dead, so that 
in everything he might have the 
supremacy. 

19 For God was pleased to have all his 
fullness dwell in him, 

20 and through him to reconcile to himself 
all things, whether things on earth or 
things in heaven, by making peace 
through his blood, shed on the cross. 

21 Once you were alienated from God 
and were enemies in your minds 
because of your evil behavior. 

22 But now he has reconciled you by 
Christ's physical body through death to 
present you holy in his sight, without 
blemish and free from accusation- 

23 if you continue in your faith, 
established and firm, not moved from 
the hope held out in the gospel. This is 
the gospel that you heard and that has 
been proclaimed to every creature 
under heaven, and of which I, Paul, 
have become a servant. 

24 Now I rejoice in what was suffered for 
you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still 
lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, 
for the sake of his body, which is the 
church. 

25 l have become its servant by the 
commission God gave me to present to 
you the word of God in its fullness- 

26 the mystery that has been kept hidden 
for ages and generations, but is now 
disclosed to the saints. 



To them God has chosen to make 
known among the Gentiles the glorious 
riches of this mystery, which is Christ in 
you, the hope of glory. 

28 We proclaim him, admonishing and 
teaching everyone with all wisdom, so 
that we may present everyone perfect in 
Christ. 

29 To this end I labor, struggling with all 
his energy, which so powerfully works in 
me. 



^I want you to know how much I am 
struggling for you and for those at 
Laodicea, and for all who have not met 
me personally. 

2 My purpose is that they may be 
encouraged in heart and united in love, 
so that they may have the full riches of 
complete understanding, in order that 
they may know the mystery of God, 
namely, Christ, 

3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of 
wisdom and knowledge. 

4 I tell you this so that no one may 
deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. 

5 For though I am absent from you in 
body, I am present with you in spirit and 
delight to see how orderly you are and 
how firm your faith in Christ is. 

6 So then, just as you received Christ 
Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him, 



rooted and built up in him, strengthened 
in the faith as you were taught, and 
overflowing with thankfulness. 

8 See to it that no one takes you captive 
through hollow and deceptive 
philosophy, which depends on human 
tradition and the basic principles of this 
world rather than on Christ. 

9 For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity 
lives in bodily form, 

10 and you have been given fullness in 
Christ, who is the head over every 
power and authority. 

11 ln him you were also circumcised, in 
the putting off of the sinful nature, not 
with a circumcision done by the hands 
of men but with the circumcision done 
by Christ, 

12 having been buried with him in 
baptism and raised with him through 
your faith in the power of God, who 
raised him from the dead. 

13 When you were dead in your sins and 
in the uncircumcision of your sinful 
nature, God made you alive with Christ. 
He forgave us all our sins, 

14 having canceled the written code, with 
its regulations, that was against us and 
that stood opposed to us; he took it 
away, nailing it to the cross. 

15 And having disarmed the powers and 
authorities, he made a public spectacle 
of them, triumphing over them by the 
cross. 



16 Therefore do not let anyone judge you 
by what you eat or drink, or with regard 
to a religious festival, a New Moon 
celebration or a Sabbath day. 

17 These are a shadow of the things that 
were to come; the reality, however, is 
found in Christ. 

18 Do not let anyone who delights in false 
humility and the worship of angels 
disqualify you for the prize. Such a 
person goes into great detail about what 
he has seen, and his unspiritual mind 
puffs him up with idle notions. 

19 He has lost connection with the Head, 
from whom the whole body, supported 
and held together by its ligaments and 
sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. 

20 Since you died with Christ to the basic 
principles of this world, why, as though 
you still belonged to it, do you submit to 
its rules: 

21 "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not 
touch!"? 

22 These are all destined to perish with 
use, because they are based on human 
commands and teachings. 

23 Such regulations indeed have an 
appearance of wisdom, with their self- 
imposed worship, their false humility 
and their harsh treatment of the body, 
but they lack any value in restraining 
sensual indulgence. 



OSince, then, you have been raised 
with Christ, set your hearts on things 



above, where Christ is seated at the 
right hand of God. 



with compassion, kindness, humility, 
gentleness and patience. 



2 Set your minds on things above, not on 
earthly things. 

3 For you died, and your life is now 
hidden with Christ in God. 



When Christ, who is your life, appears, 
then you also will appear with him in 
glory. 

5 Put to death, therefore, whatever 
belongs to your earthly nature: sexual 
immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires 
and greed, which is idolatry. 

6 Because of these, the wrath of God is 
coming. 

7 You used to walk in these ways, in the 
life you once lived. 

8 But now you must rid yourselves of all 
such things as these: anger, rage, 
malice, slander, and filthy language from 
your lips. 

9 Do not lie to each other, since you have 
taken off your old self with its practices 

10 and have put on the new self, which is 
being renewed in knowledge in the 
image of its Creator. 

"Here there is no Greek or Jew, 
circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, 
Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, 
and is in all. 

12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, 
holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves 



13 Bear with each other and forgive 
whatever grievances you may have 
against one another. Forgive as the 
Lord forgave you. 

14 And over all these virtues put on love, 
which binds them all together in perfect 
unity. 

15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your 
hearts, since as members of one body 
you were called to peace. And be 
thankful. 

16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you 
richly as you teach and admonish one 
another with all wisdom, and as you sing 
psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with 
gratitude in your hearts to God. 

17 And whatever you do, whether in word 
or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord 
Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father 
through him. 

18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is 
fitting in the Lord. 

19 Husbands, love your wives and do not 
be harsh with them. 

20 Children, obey your parents in 
everything, for this pleases the Lord. 

21 Fathers, do not embitter your children, 
or they will become discouraged. 

22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in 
everything; and do it, not only when their 
eye is on you and to win their favor, but 



with sincerity of heart and reverence for 
the Lord. 

23 Whatever you do, work at it with all 
your heart, as working for the Lord, not 
for men, 

24 since you know that you will receive an 
inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It 
is the Lord Christ you are serving. 

25 Anyone who does wrong will be repaid 
for his wrong, and there is no favoritism. 



tMasters, provide your slaves with 

what is right and fair, because you know 
that you also have a Master in heaven. 

2 Devote yourselves to prayer, being 
watchful and thankful. 

3 And pray for us, too, that God may 
open a door for our message, so that we 
may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for 
which I am in chains. 

4 Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I 
should. 

5 Be wise in the way you act toward 
outsiders; make the most of every 
opportunity. 

6 Let your conversation be always full of 
grace, seasoned with salt, so that you 
may know how to answer everyone. 



I am sending him to you for the express 
purpose that you may know about our 
circumstances and that he may 
encourage your hearts. 

9 He is coming with Onesimus, our 
faithful and dear brother, who is one of 
you. They will tell you everything that is 
happening here. 

10 My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends 
you his greetings, as does Mark, the 
cousin of Barnabas. (You have received 
instructions about him; if he comes to 
you, welcome him.) 

"Jesus, who is called Justus, also 
sends greetings. These are the only 
Jews among my fellow workers for the 
kingdom of God, and they have proved 
a comfort to me. 

12 Epaphras, who is one of you and a 
servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. 
He is always wrestling in prayer for you, 
that you may stand firm in all the will of 
God, mature and fully assured. 

13 l vouch for him that he is working hard 
for you and for those at Laodicea and 
Hierapolis. 

14 Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and 
Demas send greetings. 

15 Give my greetings to the brothers at 
Laodicea, and to Nympha and the 
church in her house. 



Tychicus will tell you all the news about 
me. He is a dear brother, a faithful 
minister and fellow servant in the Lord. 



After this letter has been read to you, 
see that it is also read in the church of 
the Laodiceans and that you in turn read 
the letter from Laodicea. 



17 Tell Archippus: "See to it that you 18 l, Paul, write this greeting in my own 
complete the work you have received in hand. Remember my chains. Grace be 
the Lord." with you. 



1st Thessalonians 



1 



Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the 

church of the Thessalonians in God the 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace 
and peace to you. 

2 We always thank God for all of you, 
mentioning you in our prayers. 

3 We continually remember before our 
God and Father your work produced by 
faith, your labor prompted by love, and 
your endurance inspired by hope in our 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

4 For we know, brothers loved by God, 
that he has chosen you, 

5 because our gospel came to you not 
simply with words, but also with power, 
with the Holy Spirit and with deep 
conviction. You know how we lived 
among you for your sake. 

6 You became imitators of us and of the 
Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you 
welcomed the message with the joy 
given by the Holy Spirit. 

7 And so you became a model to all the 
believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 

8 The Lord's message rang out from you 
not only in Macedonia and Achaia-your 
faith in God has become known 
everywhere. Therefore we do not need 
to say anything about it, 



9 for they themselves report what kind of 
reception you gave us. They tell how 
you turned to God from idols to serve 
the living and true God, 

10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, 
whom he raised from the dead-Jesus, 
who rescues us from the coming wrath. 



fcYou know, brothers, that our visit to 
you was not a failure. 

2 We had previously suffered and been 
insulted in Philippi, as you know, but 
with the help of our God we dared to tell 
you his gospel in spite of strong 
opposition. 

3 For the appeal we make does not 
spring from error or impure motives, nor 
are we trying to trick you. 

4 0n the contrary, we speak as men 
approved by God to be entrusted with 
the gospel. We are not trying to please 
men but God, who tests our hearts. 

5 You know we never used flattery, nor 
did we put on a mask to cover up greed- 
-God is our witness. 

6 We were not looking for praise from 
men, not from you or anyone else. 

7 As apostles of Christ we could have 
been a burden to you, but we were 
gentle among you, like a mother caring 
for her little children. 



We loved you so much that we were 
delighted to share with you not only the 
gospel of God but our lives as well, 
because you had become so dear to us. 

9 Surely you remember, brothers, our toil 
and hardship; we worked night and day 
in order not to be a burden to anyone 
while we preached the gospel of God to 
you. 

10 You are witnesses, and so is God, of 
how holy, righteous and blameless we 
were among you who believed. 

11 For you know that we dealt with each 
of you as a father deals with his own 
children, 

12 encouraging, comforting and urging 
you to live lives worthy of God, who calls 
you into his kingdom and glory. 

13 And we also thank God continually 
because, when you received the word of 
God, which you heard from us, you 
accepted it not as the word of men, but 
as it actually is, the word of God, which 
is at work in you who believe. 

14 For you, brothers, became imitators of 
God's churches in Judea, which are in 
Christ Jesus: You suffered from your 
own countrymen the same things those 
churches suffered from the Jews, 

15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the 
prophets and also drove us out. They 
displease God and are hostile to all men 

16 in their effort to keep us from speaking 
to the Gentiles so that they may be 
saved. In this way they always heap up 



their sins to the limit. The wrath of God 
has come upon them at last. 

17 But, brothers, when we were torn 
away from you for a short time (in 
person, not in thought), out of our 
intense longing we made every effort to 
see you. 

18 For we wanted to come to you- 
certainly I, Paul, did, again and again- 
but Satan stopped us. 

19 For what is our hope, our joy, or the 
crown in which we will glory in the 
presence of our Lord Jesus when he 
comes? Is it not you? 

20 lndeed, you are our glory and joy. 



OSo when we could stand it no longer, 

we thought it best to be left by ourselves 
in Athens. 

2 We sent Timothy, who is our brother 
and God's fellow worker in spreading 
the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and 
encourage you in your faith, 

3 so that no one would be unsettled by 
these trials. You know quite well that we 
were destined for them. 

4 ln fact, when we were with you, we kept 
telling you that we would be persecuted. 
And it turned out that way, as you well 
know. 

5 For this reason, when I could stand it 
no longer, I sent to find out about your 
faith. I was afraid that in some way the 



tempter might have tempted you and 
our efforts might have been useless. 



urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this 
more and more. 



But Timothy has just now come to us 
from you and has brought good news 
about your faith and love. He has told us 
that you always have pleasant 
memories of us and that you long to see 
us, just as we also long to see you. 

therefore, brothers, in all our distress 
and persecution we were encouraged 
about you because of your faith. 

8 For now we really live, since you are 
standing firm in the Lord. 

9 How can we thank God enough for you 
in return for all the joy we have in the 
presence of our God because of you? 

10 Night and day we pray most earnestly 
that we may see you again and supply 
what is lacking in your faith. 

11 Now may our God and Father himself 
and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us 
to come to you. 

12 May the Lord make your love increase 
and overflow for each other and for 
everyone else, just as ours does for you. 

13 May he strengthen your hearts so that 
you will be blameless and holy in the 
presence of our God and Father when 
our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy 
ones. 



"Finally, brothers, we instructed you 

how to live in order to please God, as in 
fact you are living. Now we ask you and 



"For you know what instructions we 
gave you by the authority of the Lord 
Jesus. 

3 lt is God's will that you should be 
sanctified: that you should avoid sexual 
immorality; 

4 that each of you should learn to control 
his own body in a way that is holy and 
honorable, 

5 not in passionate lust like the heathen, 
who do not know God; 

6 and that in this matter no one should 
wrong his brother or take advantage of 
him. The Lord will punish men for all 
such sins, as we have already told you 
and warned you. 

7 For God did not call us to be impure, 
but to live a holy life. 

therefore, he who rejects this 
instruction does not reject man but God, 
who gives you his Holy Spirit. 

9 Now about brotherly love we do not 
need to write to you, for you yourselves 
have been taught by God to love each 
other. 

10 And in fact, you do love all the 
brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we 
urge you, brothers, to do so more and 
more. 

"Make it your ambition to lead a quiet 
life, to mind your own business and to 



work with your hands, just as we told 
you, 

12 so that your daily life may win the 
respect of outsiders and so that you will 
not be dependent on anybody. 

13 Brothers, we do not want you to be 
ignorant about those who fall asleep, or 
to grieve like the rest of men, who have 
no hope. 

14 We believe that Jesus died and rose 
again and so we believe that God will 
bring with Jesus those who have fallen 
asleep in him. 



for you know very well that the day of 
the Lord will come like a thief in the 
night. 

3 While people are saying, "Peace and 
safety," destruction will come on them 
suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant 
woman, and they will not escape. 

4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness 
so that this day should surprise you like 
a thief. 

5 You are all sons of the light and sons of 
the day. We do not belong to the night 
or to the darkness. 



15 According to the Lord's own word, we 
tell you that we who are still alive, who 
are left till the coming of the Lord, will 
certainly not precede those who have 
fallen asleep. 

16 For the Lord himself will come down 
from heaven, with a loud command, with 
the voice of the archangel and with the 
trumpet call of God, and the dead in 
Christ will rise first. 

17 After that, we who are still alive and 
are left will be caught up together with 
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in 
the air. And so we will be with the Lord 
forever. 

18 Therefore encourage each other with 
these words. 



So then, let us not be like others, who 
are asleep, but let us be alert and self- 
controlled. 

7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, 
and those who get drunk, get drunk at 
night. 

8 But since we belong to the day, let us 
be self-controlled, putting on faith and 
love as a breastplate, and the hope of 
salvation as a helmet. 

9 For God did not appoint us to suffer 
wrath but to receive salvation through 
our Lord Jesus Christ. 

10 He died for us so that, whether we are 
awake or asleep, we may live together 
with him. 



i/Now, brothers, about times and dates 
we do not need to write to you, 



Therefore encourage one another and 
build each other up, just as in fact you 
are doing. 



12 Now we ask you, brothers, to respect 
those who work hard among you, who 
are over you in the Lord and who 
admonish you. 

13 Hold them in the highest regard in love 
because of their work. Live in peace 
with each other. 

14 And we urge you, brothers, warn those 
who are idle, encourage the timid, help 
the weak, be patient with everyone. 

15 Make sure that nobody pays back 
wrong for wrong, but always try to be 
kind to each other and to everyone else. 

16 Be joyful always; 

17 pray continually; 

18 give thanks in all circumstances, for 
this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 

19 Do not put out the Spirit's fire; 



20 do not treat prophecies with contempt. 

21 Test everything. Hold on to the good. 

22 Avoid every kind of evil. 

23 May God himself, the God of peace, 
sanctify you through and through. May 
your whole spirit, soul and body be kept 
blameless at the coming of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 



24 The one who calls you is faithful and 
he will do it. 



25 



26 



Brothers, pray for us. 

Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 



27 



I charge you before the Lord to have 
this letter read to all the brothers. 



23- 



The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you. 



2nd Thessalonians 



I Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the 

church of the Thessalonians in God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 

2 Grace and peace to you from God the 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

3 We ought always to thank God for you, 
brothers, and rightly so, because your 
faith is growing more and more, and the 
love every one of you has for each other 
is increasing. 

therefore, among God's churches we 
boast about your perseverance and faith 
in all the persecutions and trials you are 
enduring. 

5 AII this is evidence that God's judgment 
is right, and as a result you will be 
counted worthy of the kingdom of God, 
for which you are suffering. 

6 God is just: He will pay back trouble to 
those who trouble you 

7 and give relief to you who are troubled, 
and to us as well. This will happen when 
the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven 
in blazing fire with his powerful angels. 

8 He will punish those who do not know 
God and do not obey the gospel of our 
Lord Jesus. 

9 They will be punished with everlasting 
destruction and shut out from the 



presence of the Lord and from the 
majesty of his power 

10 on the day he comes to be glorified in 
his holy people and to be marveled at 
among all those who have believed. 
This includes you, because you believed 
our testimony to you. 

"With this in mind, we constantly pray 
for you, that our God may count you 
worthy of his calling, and that by his 
power he may fulfill every good purpose 
of yours and every act prompted by your 
faith. 

12 We pray this so that the name of our 
Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and 
you in him, according to the grace of our 
God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 



^Concerning the coming of our Lord 

Jesus Christ and our being gathered to 
him, we ask you, brothers, 

2 not to become easily unsettled or 
alarmed by some prophecy, report or 
letter supposed to have come from us, 
saying that the day of the Lord has 
already come. 

3 Don't let anyone deceive you in any 
way, for that day will not come until the 
rebellion occurs and the man of 
lawlessness is revealed, the man 
doomed to destruction. 

4 He will oppose and will exalt himself 
over everything that is called God or is 



worshiped, so that he sets himself up in 
God's temple, proclaiming himself to be 
God. 



you to be saved through the sanctifying 
work of the Spirit and through belief in 
the truth. 



5 Don't you remember that when I was 
with you I used to tell you these things? 

6 And now you know what is holding him 
back, so that he may be revealed at the 
proper time. 

7 For the secret power of lawlessness is 
already at work; but the one who now 
holds it back will continue to do so till he 
is taken out of the way. 

8 And then the lawless one will be 
revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will 
overthrow with the breath of his mouth 
and destroy by the splendor of his 
coming. 

9 The coming of the lawless one will be in 
accordance with the work of Satan 
displayed in all kinds of counterfeit 
miracles, signs and wonders, 

10 and in every sort of evil that deceives 
those who are perishing. They perish 
because they refused to love the truth 
and so be saved. 



For this reason God 
powerful delusion so 
believe the lie 



sends them a 
that they will 



and so that all will be condemned who 
have not believed the truth but have 
delighted in wickedness. 

13 But we ought always to thank God for 
you, brothers loved by the Lord, 
because from the beginning God chose 



He called you to this through our 
gospel, that you might share in the glory 
of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold 
to the teachings we passed on to you, 
whether by word of mouth or by letter. 

16 May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and 
God our Father, who loved us and by 
his grace gave us eternal 
encouragement and good hope, 

17 encourage your hearts and strengthen 
you in every good deed and word. 



O Finally, brothers, pray for us that the 

message of the Lord may spread rapidly 
and be honored, just as it was with you. 

2 And pray that we may be delivered 
from wicked and evil men, for not 
everyone has faith. 

3 But the Lord is faithful, and he will 
strengthen and protect you from the evil 
one. 

4 We have confidence in the Lord that 
you are doing and will continue to do the 
things we command. 

5 May the Lord direct your hearts into 
God's love and Christ's perseverance. 

6 ln the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
we command you, brothers, to keep 



away from every brother who is idle and 
does not live according to the teaching 
you received from us. 

7 For you yourselves know how you 
ought to follow our example. We were 
not idle when we were with you, 

8 nor did we eat anyone's food without 
paying for it. On the contrary, we worked 
night and day, laboring and toiling so 
that we would not be a burden to any of 
you. 

9 We did this, not because we do not 
have the right to such help, but in order 
to make ourselves a model for you to 
follow. 

10 For even when we were with you, we 
gave you this rule: "If a man will not 
work, he shall not eat." 

11 We hear that some among you are idle. 
They are not busy; they are busybodies. 



Such people we command and urge in 
the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and 
earn the bread they eat. 

13 And as for you, brothers, never tire of 
doing what is right. 

14 lf anyone does not obey our instruction 
in this letter, take special note of him. 
Do not associate with him, in order that 
he may feel ashamed. 

15 Yet do not regard him as an enemy, 
but warn him as a brother. 

16 Now may the Lord of peace himself 
give you peace at all times and in every 
way. The Lord be with all of you. 

17 l, Paul, write this greeting in my own 
hand, which is the distinguishing mark in 
all my letters. This is how I write. 

18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you all. 



1st Timothy 



1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by 

the command of God our Savior and of 
Christ Jesus our hope, 

2 To Timothy my true son in the faith: 
Grace, mercy and peace from God the 
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 

3 As I urged you when I went into 
Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so 
that you may command certain men not 
to teach false doctrines any longer 

4 nor to devote themselves to myths and 
endless genealogies. These promote 
controversies rather than God's work- 
which is by faith. 

5 The goal of this command is love, 
which comes from a pure heart and a 
good conscience and a sincere faith. 

6 Some have wandered away from these 
and turned to meaningless talk. 

7 They want to be teachers of the law, 
but they do not know what they are 
talking about or what they so confidently 
affirm. 

8 We know that the law is good if one 
uses it properly. 

9 We also know that law is made not for 
the righteous but for lawbreakers and 
rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the 



unholy and irreligious; for those who kill 
their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 

10 for adulterers and perverts, for slave 
traders and liars and perjurers-and for 
whatever else is contrary to the sound 
doctrine 

"that conforms to the glorious gospel of 
the blessed God, which he entrusted to 
me. 

12 l thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has 
given me strength, that he considered 
me faithful, appointing me to his service. 

13 Even though I was once a blasphemer 
and a persecutor and a violent man, I 
was shown mercy because I acted in 
ignorance and unbelief. 

14 The grace of our Lord was poured out 
on me abundantly, along with the faith 
and love that are in Christ Jesus. 

15 Here is a trustworthy saying that 
deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus 
came into the world to save sinners-of 
whom I am the worst. 

16 But for that very reason I was shown 
mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, 
Christ Jesus might display his unlimited 
patience as an example for those who 
would believe on him and receive 
eternal life. 

17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, 
invisible, the only God, be honor and 
glory for ever and ever. Amen. 



Timothy, my son, I give you this 
instruction in keeping with the 
prophecies once made about you, so 
that by following them you may fight the 
good fight, 

19 holding on to faith and a good 
conscience. Some have rejected these 
and so have shipwrecked their faith. 

20 Among them are Hymenaeus and 
Alexander, whom I have handed over to 
Satan to be taught not to blaspheme. 



I want men everywhere to lift up holy 
hands in prayer, without anger or 
disputing. 

9 I also want women to dress modestly, 
with decency and propriety, not with 
braided hair or gold or pearls or 
expensive clothes, 

10 but with good deeds, appropriate for 
women who profess to worship God. 

11 A woman should learn in quietness 
and full submission. 



^I urge, then, first of all, that requests, 
prayers, intercession and thanksgiving 
be made for everyone- 



I do not permit a woman to teach or to 
have authority over a man; she must be 
silent. 



for kings and all those in authority, that 
we may live peaceful and quiet lives in 
all godliness and holiness. 

3 This is good, and pleases God our 
Savior, 

4 who wants all men to be saved and to 
come to a knowledge of the truth. 



For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 

14 And Adam was not the one deceived; 
it was the woman who was deceived 
and became a sinner. 

15 But women will be saved through 
childbearingâ€” if they continue in faith, 
love and holiness with propriety. 



For there is one God and one mediator 
between God and men, the man Christ 
Jesus, 

6 who gave himself as a ransom for all 
men-the testimony given in its proper 
time. 

7 And for this purpose I was appointed a 
herald and an apostle-l am telling the 
truth, I am not lying-and a teacher of 
the true faith to the Gentiles. 



OHere is a trustworthy saying: If 

anyone sets his heart on being an 
overseer, he desires a noble task. 

2 Now the overseer must be above 
reproach, the husband of but one wife, 
temperate, self-controlled, respectable, 
hospitable, able to teach, 

3 not given to drunkenness, not violent 
but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover 
of money. 



4 He must manage his own family well 
and see that his children obey him with 
proper respect. 

5 (lf anyone does not know how to 
manage his own family, how can he 
take care of God's church?) 

6 He must not be a recent convert, or he 
may become conceited and fall under 
the same judgment as the devil. 

7 He must also have a good reputation 
with outsiders, so that he will not fall into 
disgrace and into the devil's trap. 

8 Deacons, likewise, are to be men 
worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging 
in much wine, and not pursuing 
dishonest gain. 

9 They must keep hold of the deep truths 
of the faith with a clear conscience. 

10 They must first be tested; and then if 
there is nothing against them, let them 
serve as deacons. 

11 In the same way, their wives are to be 
women worthy of respect, not malicious 
talkers but temperate and trustworthy in 
everything. 



if I am delayed, you will know how 
people ought to conduct themselves in 
God's household, which is the church of 
the living God, the pillar and foundation 
of the truth. 

16 Beyond all question, the mystery of 
godliness is great: He appeared in a 
body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was 
seen by angels, was preached among 
the nations, was believed on in the 
world, was taken up in glory. 



tThe Spirit clearly says that in later 
times some will abandon the faith and 
follow deceiving spirits and things taught 
by demons. 

2 Such teachings come through 
hypocritical liars, whose consciences 
have been seared as with a hot iron. 

3 They forbid people to marry and order 
them to abstain from certain foods, 
which God created to be received with 
thanksgiving by those who believe and 
who know the truth. 

4 For everything God created is good, 
and nothing is to be rejected if it is 
received with thanksgiving, 



A deacon must be the husband of but 
one wife and must manage his children 
and his household well. 

13 Those who have served well gain an 
excellent standing and great assurance 
in their faith in Christ Jesus. 

14 Although I hope to come to you soon, I 
am writing you these instructions so that, 



because it is consecrated by the word 
of God and prayer. 

6 lf you point these things out to the 
brothers, you will be a good minister of 
Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of 
the faith and of the good teaching that 
you have followed. 



Have nothing to do with godless myths 
and old wives' tales; rather, train 
yourself to be godly. 

8 For physical training is of some value, 
but godliness has value for all things, 
holding promise for both the present life 
and the life to come. 

9 This is a trustworthy saying that 
deserves full acceptance 

10 (and for this we labor and strive), that 
we have put our hope in the living God, 
who is the Savior of all men, and 
especially of those who believe. 

"Command and teach these things. 

12 Don't let anyone look down on you 
because you are young, but set an 
example for the believers in speech, in 
life, in love, in faith and in purity. 

13 Until I come, devote yourself to the 
public reading of Scripture, to preaching 
and to teaching. 

14 Do not neglect your gift, which was 
given you through a prophetic message 
when the body of elders laid their hands 
on you. 



Be diligent in these matters; 
yourself wholly to them, so 
everyone may see your progress. 



give 
that 



Watch your life and doctrine closely. 
Persevere in them, because if you do, 
you will save both yourself and your 
hearers. 



*J Do not rebuke an older man harshly, 

but exhort him as if he were your father. 
Treat younger men as brothers, 

2 older women as mothers, and younger 
women as sisters, with absolute purity. 

3 Give proper recognition to those 
widows who are really in need. 

4 But if a widow has children or 
grandchildren, these should learn first of 
all to put their religion into practice by 
caring for their own family and so 
repaying their parents and grandparents, 
for this is pleasing to God. 

5 The widow who is really in need and 
left all alone puts her hope in God and 
continues night and day to pray and to 
ask God for help. 

6 But the widow who lives for pleasure is 
dead even while she lives. 

7 Give the people these instructions, too, 
so that no one may be open to blame. 

8 lf anyone does not provide for his 
relatives, and especially for his 
immediate family, he has denied the 
faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 

9 No widow may be put on the list of 
widows unless she is over sixty, has 
been faithful to her husband, 

10 and is well known for her good deeds, 
such as bringing up children, showing 
hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, 
helping those in trouble and devoting 
herself to all kinds of good deeds. 



As for younger widows, do not put 
them on such a list. For when their 
sensual desires overcome their 
dedication to Christ, they want to marry. 

12 Thus they bring judgment on 
themselves, because they have broken 
their first pledge. 



Those who sin are to be rebuked 
publicly, so that the others may take 
warning. 

21 l charge you, in the sight of God and 
Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to 
keep these instructions without partiality, 
and to do nothing out of favoritism. 



13 Besides, they get into the habit of 
being idle and going about from house 
to house. And not only do they become 
idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, 
saying things they ought not to. 

14 So I counsel younger widows to marry, 
to have children, to manage their homes 
and to give the enemy no opportunity for 
slander. 

15 Some have in fact already turned 
away to follow Satan. 

16 lf any woman who is a believer has 
widows in her family, she should help 
them and not let the church be 
burdened with them, so that the church 
can help those widows who are really in 
need. 

17 The elders who direct the affairs of the 
church well are worthy of double honor, 
especially those whose work is 
preaching and teaching. 

18 For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle 
the ox while it is treading out the grain," 
and "The worker deserves his wages." 

19 Do not entertain an accusation against 
an elder unless it is brought by two or 
three witnesses. 



Do not be hasty in the laying on of 
hands, and do not share in the sins of 
others. Keep yourself pure. 

23 Stop drinking only water, and use a 
little wine because of your stomach and 
your frequent illnesses. 

24 The sins of some men are obvious, 
reaching the place of judgment ahead of 
them; the sins of others trail behind 
them. 

25 ln the same way, good deeds are 
obvious, and even those that are not 
cannot be hidden. 



WAN who are under the yoke of slavery 
should consider their masters worthy of 
full respect, so that God's name and our 
teaching may not be slandered. 

2 Those who have believing masters are 
not to show less respect for them 
because they are brothers. Instead, they 
are to serve them even better, because 
those who benefit from their service are 
believers, and dear to them. These are 
the things you are to teach and urge on 
them. 

3 lf anyone teaches false doctrines and 
does not agree to the sound instruction 



of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly 
teaching, 

4 he is conceited and understands 
nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in 
controversies and quarrels about words 
that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, 
evil suspicions 



13 ln the sight of God, who gives life to 
everything, and of Christ Jesus, who 
while testifying before Pontius Pilate 
made the good confession, I charge you 

14 to keep this command without spot or 
blame until the appearing of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, 



and constant friction between men of 
corrupt mind, who have been robbed of 
the truth and who think that godliness is 
a means to financial gain. 

6 But godliness with contentment is great 
gain. 

7 For we brought nothing into the world, 
and we can take nothing out of it. 

8 But if we have food and clothing, we 
will be content with that. 

9 People who want to get rich fall into 
temptation and a trap and into many 
foolish and harmful desires that plunge 
men into ruin and destruction. 

10 For the love of money is a root of all 
kinds of evil. Some people, eager for 
money, have wandered from the faith 
and pierced themselves with many 
griefs. 

11 But you, man of God, flee from all this, 
and pursue righteousness, godliness, 
faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 

12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take 
hold of the eternal life to which you were 
called when you made your good 
confession in the presence of many 
witnesses. 



15 which God will bring about in his own 
time-God, the blessed and only Ruler, 
the King of kings and Lord of lords, 

16 who alone is immortal and who lives in 
unapproachable light, whom no one has 
seen or can see. To him be honor and 
might forever. Amen. 

17 Command those who are rich in this 
present world not to be arrogant nor to 
put their hope in wealth, which is so 
uncertain, but to put their hope in God, 
who richly provides us with everything 
for our enjoyment. 

18 Command them to do good, to be rich 
in good deeds, and to be generous and 
willing to share. 

19 ln this way they will lay up treasure for 
themselves as a firm foundation for the 
coming age, so that they may take hold 
of the life that is truly life. 

20 Timothy, guard what has been 
entrusted to your care. Turn away from 
godless chatter and the opposing ideas 
of what is falsely called knowledge, 

21 which some have professed and in so 
doing have wandered from the faith. 
Grace be with you. 



2nd Timothy 



1 



Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by 

the will of God, according to the promise 
of life that is in Christ Jesus, 

2 To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy 
and peace from God the Father and 
Christ Jesus our Lord. 

3 I thank God, whom I serve, as my 
forefathers did, with a clear conscience, 
as night and day I constantly remember 
you in my prayers. 

4 Recalling your tears, I long to see you, 
so that I may be filled with joy. 

5 I have been reminded of your sincere 
faith, which first lived in your 
grandmother Lois and in your mother 
Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives 
in you also. 

6 For this reason I remind you to fan into 
flame the gift of God, which is in you 
through the laying on of my hands. 

7 For God did not give us a spirit of 
timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and 
of self-discipline. 

8 So do not be ashamed to testify about 
our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. 
But join with me in suffering for the 
gospel, by the power of God, 

9 who has saved us and called us to a 
holy lifeâ€”not because of anything we 



have done but because of his own 
purpose and grace. This grace was 
given us in Christ Jesus before the 
beginning of time, 

10 but it has now been revealed through 
the appearing of our Savior, Christ 
Jesus, who has destroyed death and 
has brought life and immortality to light 
through the gospel. 

11 And of this gospel I was appointed a 
herald and an apostle and a teacher. 

12 That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet 
I am not ashamed, because I know 
whom I have believed, and am 
convinced that he is able to guard what I 
have entrusted to him for that day. 

13 What you heard from me, keep as the 
pattern of sound teaching, with faith and 
love in Christ Jesus. 

14 Guard the good deposit that was 
entrusted to you-guard it with the help 
of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 

15 You know that everyone in the 
province of Asia has deserted me, 
including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 

16 May the Lord show mercy to the 
household of Onesiphorus, because he 
often refreshed me and was not 
ashamed of my chains. 

17 On the contrary, when he was in 
Rome, he searched hard for me until he 
found me. 



18 May the Lord grant that he will find 
mercy from the Lord on that day! You 
know very well in how many ways he 
helped me in Ephesus. 



fcYou then, my son, be strong in the 
grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

2 And the things you have heard me say 
in the presence of many witnesses 
entrust to reliable men who will also be 
qualified to teach others. 

3 Endure hardship with us like a good 
soldier of Christ Jesus. 

4 No one serving as a soldier gets 
involved in civilian affairs-he wants to 
please his commanding officer. 

Similarly, if anyone competes as an 
athlete, he does not receive the victor's 
crown unless he competes according to 
the rules. 

6 The hardworking farmer should be the 
first to receive a share of the crops. 

7 Reflect on what I am saying, for the 
Lord will give you insight into all this. 

8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from 
the dead, descended from David. This is 
my gospel, 

9 for which I am suffering even to the 
point of being chained like a criminal. 
But God's word is not chained. 

10 Therefore I endure everything for the 
sake of the elect, that they too may 



obtain the salvation that is in Christ 
Jesus, with eternal glory. 

"Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died 
with him, we will also live with him; 

12 if we endure, we will also reign with 
him. If we disown him, he will also 
disown us; 

13 if we are faithless, he will remain 
faithful, for he cannot disown himself. 

14 Keep reminding them of these things. 
Warn them before God against 
quarreling about words; it is of no value, 
and only ruins those who listen. 

15 Do your best to present yourself to 
God as one approved, a workman who 
does not need to be ashamed and who 
correctly handles the word of truth. 

16 Avoid godless chatter, because those 
who indulge in it will become more and 
more ungodly. 

17 Their teaching will spread like 
gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus 
and Philetus, 

18 who have wandered away from the 
truth. They say that the resurrection has 
already taken place, and they destroy 
the faith of some. 

^Nevertheless, God's solid foundation 
stands firm, sealed with this inscription: 
"The Lord knows those who are his," 
and, "Everyone who confesses the 
name of the Lord must turn away from 
wickedness." 



20 ln a large house there are articles not 
only of gold and silver, but also of wood 
and clay; some are for noble purposes 
and some for ignoble. 

21 If a man cleanses himself from the 
latter, he will be an instrument for noble 
purposes, made holy, useful to the 
Master and prepared to do any good 
work. 

22 Flee the evil desires of youth, and 
pursue righteousness, faith, love and 
peace, along with those who call on the 
Lord out of a pure heart. 



without love, unforgiving, slanderous, 
without self-control, brutal, not lovers of 
the good, 

treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of 
pleasure rather than lovers of God- 
caving a form of godliness but denying 
its power. Have nothing to do with them. 

6 They are the kind who worm their way 
into homes and gain control over weak- 
willed women, who are loaded down 
with sins and are swayed by all kinds of 
evil desires, 



Don't have anything to do with foolish 
and stupid arguments, because you 
know they produce quarrels. 

24 And the Lord's servant must not 
quarrel; instead, he must be kind to 
everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 

25 Those who oppose him he must gently 
instruct, in the hope that God will grant 
them repentance leading them to a 
knowledge of the truth, 

26 and that they will come to their senses 
and escape from the trap of the devil, 
who has taken them captive to do his 
will. 



OBut mark this: There will be terrible 
times in the last days. 

2 People will be lovers of themselves, 
lovers of money, boastful, proud, 
abusive, disobedient to their parents, 
ungrateful, unholy, 



7 always learning but never able to 
acknowledge the truth. 

8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed 
Moses, so also these men oppose the 
truth-men of depraved minds, who, as 
far as the faith is concerned, are 
rejected. 

9 But they will not get very far because, 
as in the case of those men, their folly 
will be clear to everyone. 

10 You, however, know all about my 
teaching, my way of life, my purpose, 
faith, patience, love, endurance, 

"persecutions, sufferings-what kinds of 
things happened to me in Antioch, 
Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I 
endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from 
all of them. 

12 ln fact, everyone who wants to live a 
godly life in Christ Jesus will be 
persecuted, 



while evil men and impostors will go 
from bad to worse, deceiving and being 
deceived. 

14 But as for you, continue in what you 
have learned and have become 
convinced of, because you know those 
from whom you learned it, 

15 and how from infancy you have known 
the holy Scriptures, which are able to 
make you wise for salvation through 
faith in Christ Jesus. 

16 AII Scripture is God-breathed and is 
useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting 
and training in righteousness, 



But you, keep your head in all 
situations, endure hardship, do the work 
of an evangelist, discharge all the duties 
of your ministry. 

6 For I am already being poured out like 
a drink offering, and the time has come 
for my departure. 

7 I have fought the good fight, I have 
finished the race, I have kept the faith. 

8 Now there is in store for me the crown 
of righteousness, which the Lord, the 
righteous Judge, will award to me on 
that day-and not only to me, but also to 
all who have longed for his appearing. 



so that the man of God may be 
thoroughly equipped for every good 
work. 



fin the presence of God and of Christ 

Jesus, who will judge the living and the 
dead, and in view of his appearing and 
his kingdom, I give you this charge: 

2 Preach the Word; be prepared in 
season and out of season; correct, 
rebuke and encourage-with great 
patience and careful instruction. 

3 For the time will come when men will 
not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, 
to suit their own desires, they will gather 
around them a great number of teachers 
to say what their itching ears want to 
hear. 

4 They will turn their ears away from the 
truth and turn aside to myths. 



9 Do your best to come to me quickly, 

10 for Demas, because he loved this 
world, has deserted me and has gone to 
Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to 
Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 

"Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and 
bring him with you, because he is 
helpful to me in my ministry. 

12 l sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 

13 When you come, bring the cloak that I 
left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, 
especially the parchments. 

14 Alexander the metalworker did me a 
great deal of harm. The Lord will repay 
him for what he has done. 

15 You too should be on your guard 
against him, because he strongly 
opposed our message. 



16 At my first defense, no one came to 
my support, but everyone deserted me. 
May it not be held against them. 

17 But the Lord stood at my side and 
gave me strength, so that through me 
the message might be fully proclaimed 
and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I 
was delivered from the lion's mouth. 



19 Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the 
household of Onesiphorus. 

20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left 
Trophimus sick in Miletus. 



Do your best to get here before winter. 
Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, 
Linus, Claudia and all the brothers. 



The Lord will rescue me from every 
evil attack and will bring me safely to his 
heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for 
ever and ever. Amen. 



22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be 
with you. 



Titus 



1 



Paul, a servant of God and an 

apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of 
God's elect and the knowledge of the 
truth that leads to godliness- 

2 a faith and knowledge resting on the 
hope of eternal life, which God, who 
does not lie, promised before the 
beginning of time, 

3 and at his appointed season he brought 
his word to light through the preaching 
entrusted to me by the command of God 
our Savior, 

4 To Titus, my true son in our common 
faith: Grace and peace from God the 
Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. 

5 The reason I left you in Crete was that 
you might straighten out what was left 
unfinished and appoint elders in every 
town, as I directed you. 

6 An elder must be blameless, the 
husband of but one wife, a man whose 
children believe and are not open to the 
charge of being wild and disobedient. 

7 Since an overseer is entrusted with 
God's work, he must be blameless-not 
overbearing, not quick-tempered, not 
given to drunkenness, not violent, not 
pursuing dishonest gain. 



Rather he must be hospitable, one who 
loves what is good, who is self- 
controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. 

9 He must hold firmly to the trustworthy 
message as it has been taught, so that 
he can encourage others by sound 
doctrine and refute those who oppose it. 

10 For there are many rebellious people, 
mere talkers and deceivers, especially 
those of the circumcision group. 

"They must be silenced, because they 
are ruining whole households by 
teaching things they ought not to teach- 
and that for the sake of dishonest gain. 

12 Even one of their own prophets has 
said, "Cretans are always liars, evil 
brutes, lazy gluttons." 

13 This testimony is true. Therefore, 
rebuke them sharply, so that they will be 
sound in the faith 

14 and will pay no attention to Jewish 
myths or to the commands of those who 
reject the truth. 

15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to 
those who are corrupted and do not 
believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both 
their minds and consciences are 
corrupted. 

16 They claim to know God, but by their 
actions they deny him. They are 
detestable, disobedient and unfit for 
doing anything good. 



fcYou must teach what is in accord 
with sound doctrine. 

2 Teach the older men to be temperate, 
worthy of respect, self-controlled, and 
sound in faith, in love and in endurance. 

3 Likewise, teach the older women to be 
reverent in the way they live, not to be 
slanderers or addicted to much wine, 
but to teach what is good. 

4 Then they can train the younger women 
to love their husbands and children, 

5 to be self-controlled and pure, to be 

busy at home, to be kind, and to be 

subject to their husbands, so that no 
one will malign the word of God. 



For the grace of God that brings 
salvation has appeared to all men. 

12 lt teaches us to say "No" to 
ungodliness and worldly passions, and 
to live self-controlled, upright and godly 
lives in this present age, 

13 while we wait for the blessed hope- 
the glorious appearing of our great God 
and Savior, Jesus Christ, 

14 who gave himself for us to redeem us 
from all wickedness and to purify for 
himself a people that are his very own, 
eager to do what is good. 

15 These, then, are the things you should 
teach. Encourage and rebuke with all 
authority. Do not let anyone despise you. 



Similarly, encourage the young men to 
be self-controlled. 

7 ln everything set them an example by 
doing what is good. In your teaching 
show integrity, seriousness 

8 and soundness of speech that cannot 
be condemned, so that those who 
oppose you may be ashamed because 
they have nothing bad to say about us. 

9 Teach slaves to be subject to their 
masters in everything, to try to please 
them, not to talk back to them, 

10 and not to steal from them, but to 
show that they can be fully trusted, so 
that in every way they will make the 
teaching about God our Savior attractive. 



O Remind the people to be subject to 

rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to 
be ready to do whatever is good, 

2 to slander no one, to be peaceable and 
considerate, and to show true humility 
toward all men. 

3 At one time we too were foolish, 
disobedient, deceived and enslaved by 
all kinds of passions and pleasures. We 
lived in malice and envy, being hated 
and hating one another. 

4 But when the kindness and love of God 
our Savior appeared, 

5 he saved us, not because of righteous 
things we had done, but because of his 
mercy. He saved us through the 



washing of rebirth and renewal by the 
Holy Spirit, 



You may be sure that such a man is 
warped and sinful; he is self-condemned. 



whom he poured out on us generously 
through Jesus Christ our Savior, 

7 so that, having been justified by his 
grace, we might become heirs having 
the hope of eternal life. 

8 This is a trustworthy saying. And I want 
you to stress these things, so that those 
who have trusted in God may be careful 
to devote themselves to doing what is 
good. These things are excellent and 
profitable for everyone. 

9 But avoid foolish controversies and 
genealogies and arguments and 
quarrels about the law, because these 
are unprofitable and useless. 



As soon as I send Artemas or 
Tychicus to you, do your best to come to 
me at Nicopolis, because I have decided 
to winter there. 

13 Do everything you can to help Zenas 
the lawyer and Apollos on their way and 
see that they have everything they need. 

14 Our people must learn to devote 
themselves to doing what is good, in 
order that they may provide for daily 
necessities and not live unproductive 
lives. 

15 Everyone with me sends you greetings. 
Greet those who love us in the faith. 
Grace be with you all. 



Warn a divisive person once, and then 
warn him a second time. After that, have 
nothing to do with him. 



Philemon 



1 



Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and 
Timothy our brother, 

2 To Philemon our dear friend and fellow 
worker, to Apphia our sister, to 
Archippus our fellow soldier and to the 
church that meets in your home: 

3 Grace to you and peace from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

4 I always thank my God as I remember 
you in my prayers, 

5 because I hear about your faith in the 
Lord Jesus and your love for all the 
saints. 

6 I pray that you may be active in sharing 
your faith, so that you will have a full 
understanding of every good thing we 
have in Christ. 

7 Your love has given me great joy and 
encouragement, because you, brother, 
have refreshed the hearts of the saints. 

therefore, although in Christ I could be 
bold and order you to do what you ought 
to do, 

9 yet | appeal to you on the basis of love. 
I then, as Paul-an old man and now 
also a prisoner of Christ Jesus- 



10 l appeal to you for my son Onesimus, 
who became my son while I was in 
chains. 

"Formerly he was useless to you, but 
now he has become useful both to you 
and to me. 

12 l am sending him-who is my very 
heart-back to you. 

13 l would have liked to keep him with me 
so that he could take your place in 
helping me while I am in chains for the 
gospel. 

14 But I did not want to do anything 
without your consent, so that any favor 
you do will be spontaneous and not 
forced. 

15 Perhaps the reason he was separated 
from you for a little while was that you 
might have him back for good- 

16 no longer as a slave, but better than a 
slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear 
to me but even dearer to you, both as a 
man and as a brother in the Lord. 

17 So if you consider me a partner, 
welcome him as you would welcome me. 

18 lf he has done you any wrong or owes 
you anything, charge it to me. 

19 l, Paul, am writing this with my own 
hand. I will pay it back-not to mention 
that you owe me your very self. 



I do wish, brother, that I may have 
some benefit from you in the Lord; 
refresh my heart in Christ. 

21 Confident of your obedience, I write to 
you, knowing that you will do even more 
than I ask. 

22 And one thing more: Prepare a guest 
room for me, because I hope to be 
restored to you in answer to your 
prayers. 



23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ 
Jesus, sends you greetings. 

24 And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas 
and Luke, my fellow workers. 

25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be 
with your spirit. 



Hebrews 



1 



In the past God spoke to our 

forefathers through the prophets at 
many times and in various ways, 

2 but in these last days he has spoken to 
us by his Son, whom he appointed heir 
of all things, and through whom he 
made the universe. 

3 The Son is the radiance of God's glory 
and the exact representation of his 
being, sustaining all things by his 
powerful word. After he had provided 
purification for sins, he sat down at the 
right hand of the Majesty in heaven. 

4 So he became as much superior to the 
angels as the name he has inherited is 
superior to theirs. 

5 For to which of the angels did God ever 
say, "You are my Son; today I have 
become your Father " ? Or again, "I will 
be his Father, and he will be my Son" ? 



You have loved righteousness and 
hated wickedness; therefore God, your 
God, has set you above your 
companions by anointing you with the oil 
of joy." 

10 He also says, "In the beginning, O 
Lord, you laid the foundations of the 
earth, and the heavens are the work of 
your hands. 

"They will perish, but you remain; they 
will all wear out like a garment. 

12 You will roll them up like a robe; like a 
garment they will be changed. But you 
remain the same, and your years will 
never end." 

13 To which of the angels did God ever 
say, "Sit at my right hand until I make 
your enemies a footstool for your feet" ? 

14 Are not all angels ministering spirits 
sent to serve those who will inherit 
salvation? 



And again, when God brings his 
firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all 
God's angels worship him." 

7 ln speaking of the angels he says, "He 
makes his angels winds, his servants 
flames of fire." 

8 But about the Son he says, "Your 
throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, 
and righteousness will be the scepter of 
your kingdom. 



fcWe must pay more careful attention, 

therefore, to what we have heard, so 
that we do not drift away. 

2 For if the message spoken by angels 
was binding, and every violation and 
disobedience received its just 
punishment, 

3 how shall we escape if we ignore such 
a great salvation? This salvation, which 



was first announced by the Lord, was 
confirmed to us by those who heard him. 

4 God also testified to it by signs, 
wonders and various miracles, and gifts 
of the Holy Spirit distributed according to 
his will. 



He says, "I will declare your name to 
my brothers; in the presence of the 
congregation I will sing your praises." 

13 And again, "I will put my trust in him." 
And again he says, "Here am I, and the 
children God has given me." 



It is not to angels that he has subjected 
the world to come, about which we are 
speaking. 

6 But there is a place where someone 
has testified: "What is man that you are 
mindful of him, the son of man that you 
care for him? 

7 You made him a little lower than the 
angels; you crowned him with glory and 
honor 

8 and put everything under his feet.? In 
putting everything under him, God left 
nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at 
present we do not see everything 
subject to him. 



Since the children have flesh and 
blood, he too shared in their humanity 
so that by his death he might destroy 
him who holds the power of death-that 
is, the devilâ€” 

15 and free those who all their lives were 
held in slavery by their fear of death. 

16 For surely it is not angels he helps, but 
Abraham's descendants. 

17 For this reason he had to be made like 
his brothers in every way, in order that 
he might become a merciful and faithful 
high priest in service to God, and that he 
might make atonement for the sins of 
the people. 



But we see Jesus, who was made a 
little lower than the grace of God he 
might taste death for everyone. 



Because he himself suffered when he 
was tempted, he is able to help those 
who are being tempted. 



10 ln bringing many sons to glory, it was 
fitting that God, for whom and through 
whom everything exists, should make 
the author of their salvation perfect 
through suffering. 

"Both the one who makes men holy 
and those who are made holy are of the 
same family. So Jesus is not ashamed 
to call them brothers. 



OTherefore, holy brothers, who share 
in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts 
on Jesus, the apostle and high priest 
whom we confess. 

2 He was faithful to the one who 
appointed him, just as Moses was 
faithful in all God's house. 

3 Jesus has been found worthy of greater 
honor than Moses, just as the builder of 



a house has greater honor than the 
house itself. 

4 For every house is built by someone, 
but God is the builder of everything. 

5 Moses was faithful as a servant in all 
God's house, testifying to what would be 
said in the future. 

6 But Christ is faithful as a son over 
God's house. And we are his house, if 
we hold on to our courage and the hope 
of which we boast. 

7 So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if 
you hear his voice, 

8 do not harden your hearts as you did in 
the rebellion, during the time of testing 
in the desert, 

9 where your fathers tested and tried me 
and for forty years saw what I did. 

10 That is why I was angry with that 
generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are 
always going astray, and they have not 
known my ways.' 

11 So I declared on oath in my anger, 
'They shall never enter my rest.' " 

12 See to it, brothers, that none of you 
has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns 
away from the living God. 

13 But encourage one another daily, as 
long as it is called Today, so that none 
of you may be hardened by sin's 
deceitfulness. 



We have come to share in Christ if we 
hold firmly till the end the confidence we 
had at first. 

15 As has just been said: "Today, if you 
hear his voice, do not harden your 
hearts as you did in the rebellion." 

16 Who were they who heard and 
rebelled? Were they not all those Moses 
led out of Egypt? 

17 And with whom was he angry for forty 
years? Was it not with those who sinned, 
whose bodies fell in the desert? 

18 And to whom did God swear that they 
would never enter his rest if not to those 
who disobeyed ? 

19 So we see that they were not able to 
enter, because of their unbelief. 



^Therefore, since the promise of 

entering his rest still stands, let us be 
careful that none of you be found to 
have fallen short of it. 

2 For we also have had the gospel 
preached to us, just as they did; but the 
message they heard was of no value to 
them, because those who heard did not 
combine it with faith. 

3 Now we who have believed enter that 
rest, just as God has said, "So I 
declared on oath in my anger, 'They 
shall never enter my rest.' " 

4 And yet his work has been finished 
since the creation of the world. For 
somewhere he has spoken about the 



seventh day in these words: "And on the 
seventh day God rested from all his 
work." 

5 And again in the passage above he 
says, "They shall never enter my rest." 

6 lt still remains that some will enter that 
rest, and those who formerly had the 
gospel preached to them did not go in, 
because of their disobedience. 



Therefore God again set a certain day, 
calling it Today, when a long time later 
he spoke through David, as was said 
before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do 
not harden your hearts." 

8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God 
would not have spoken later about 
another day. 

9 There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for 
the people of God; 

10 for anyone who enters God's rest also 
rests from his own work, just as God did 
from his. 

"Let us, therefore, make every effort to 
enter that rest, so that no one will fall by 
following their example of disobedience. 

12 For the word of God is living and 
active. Sharper than any double-edged 
sword, it penetrates even to dividing 
soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it 
judges the thoughts and attitudes of the 
heart. 

13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from 
God's sight. Everything is uncovered 



and laid bare before the eyes of him to 
whom we must give account. 

14 Therefore, since we have a great high 
priest who has gone through the 
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us 
hold firmly to the faith we profess. 

15 For we do not have a high priest who 
is unable to sympathize with our 
weaknesses, but we have one who has 
been tempted in every way, just as we 
are-yet was without sin. 

16 Let us then approach the throne of 
grace with confidence, so that we may 
receive mercy and find grace to help us 
in our time of need. 



wEvery high priest is selected from 

among men and is appointed to 
represent them in matters related to 
God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 

2 He is able to deal gently with those who 
are ignorant and are going astray, since 
he himself is subject to weakness. 

3 This is why he has to offer sacrifices for 
his own sins, as well as for the sins of 
the people. 

4 No one takes this honor upon himself; 
he must be called by God, just as Aaron 
was. 

5 So Christ also did not take upon himself 
the glory of becoming a high priest. But 
God said to him, "You are my Son; 
today I have become your Father. " 



And he says in another place, "You are 
a priest forever, in the order of 
Melchizedek." 

7 During the days of Jesus' life on earth, 
he offered up prayers and petitions with 
loud cries and tears to the one who 
could save him from death, and he was 
heard because of his reverent 
submission. 

8 Although he was a son, he learned 
obedience from what he suffered 

9 and, once made perfect, he became 
the source of eternal salvation for all 
who obey him 

10 and was designated by God to be high 
priest in the order of Melchizedek. 

11 We have much to say about this, but it 
is hard to explain because you are slow 
to learn. 

12 ln fact, though by this time you ought 
to be teachers, you need someone to 
teach you the elementary truths of God's 
word all over again. You need milk, not 
solid food! 

13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still 
an infant, is not acquainted with the 
teaching about righteousness. 

14 But solid food is for the mature, who 
by constant use have trained 
themselves to distinguish good from evil. 



^Therefore let us leave the elementary 

teachings about Christ and go on to 
maturity, not laying again the foundation 



of repentance from acts that lead to 
death, and of faith in God, 

instruction about baptisms, the laying 
on of hands, the resurrection of the 
dead, and eternal judgment. 

3 And God permitting, we will do so. 

4 lt is impossible for those who have 
once been enlightened, who have tasted 
the heavenly gift, who have shared in 
the Holy Spirit, 

5 who have tasted the goodness of the 
word of God and the powers of the 
coming age, 

6 if they fall away, to be brought back to 
repentance, because to their loss they 
are crucifying the Son of God all over 
again and subjecting him to public 
disgrace. 

7 Land that drinks in the rain often falling 
on it and that produces a crop useful to 
those for whom it is farmed receives the 
blessing of God. 

8 But land that produces thorns and 
thistles is worthless and is in danger of 
being cursed. In the end it will be burned. 

9 Even though we speak like this, dear 
friends, we are confident of better things 
in your case-things that accompany 
salvation. 

10 God is not unjust; he will not forget 
your work and the love you have shown 
him as you have helped his people and 
continue to help them. 



11 We want each of you to show this 
same diligence to the very end, in order 
to make your hope sure. 

12 We do not want you to become lazy, 
but to imitate those who through faith 
and patience inherit what has been 
promised. 

13 When God made his promise to 
Abraham, since there was no one 
greater for him to swear by, he swore by 
himself, 

14 saying, "I will surely bless you and give 
you many descendants." 

15 And so after waiting patiently, 
Abraham received what was promised. 



f This Melchizedek was king of Salem 

and priest of God Most High. He met 
Abraham returning from the defeat of 
the kings and blessed him, 

2 and Abraham gave him a tenth of 
everything. First, his name means "king 
of righteousness"; then also, "king of 
Salem" means "king of peace." 

3 Without father or mother, without 
genealogy, without beginning of days or 
end of life, like the Son of God he 
remains a priest forever. 

4 Just think how great he was: Even the 
patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of 
the plunder! 



Men swear by someone greater than 
themselves, and the oath confirms what 
is said and puts an end to all argument. 

17 Because God wanted to make the 
unchanging nature of his purpose very 
clear to the heirs of what was promised, 
he confirmed it with an oath. 

18 God did this so that, by two 
unchangeable things in which it is 
impossible for God to lie, we who have 
fled to take hold of the hope offered to 
us may be greatly encouraged. 

19 We have this hope as an anchor for 
the soul, firm and secure. It enters the 
inner sanctuary behind the curtain, 

20 where Jesus, who went before us, has 
entered on our behalf. He has become a 
high priest forever, in the order of 
Melchizedek. 



Now the law requires the descendants 
of Levi who become priests to collect a 
tenth from the people-that is, their 
brothers-even though their brothers are 
descended from Abraham. 

6 This man, however, did not trace his 
descent from Levi, yet he collected a 
tenth from Abraham and blessed him 
who had the promises. 

7 And without doubt the lesser person is 
blessed by the greater. 

8 ln the one case, the tenth is collected 
by men who die; but in the other case, 
by him who is declared to be living. 

9 One might even say that Levi, who 
collects the tenth, paid the tenth through 
Abraham, 



because when Melchizedek met 
Abraham, Levi was still in the body of 
his ancestor. 

11 If perfection could have been attained 
through the Levitical priesthood (for on 
the basis of it the law was given to the 
people), why was there still need for 
another priest to come-one in the order 
of Melchizedek, not in the order of 
Aaron? 



20 And it was not without an oath! Others 
became priests without any oath, 

21 but he became a priest with an oath 
when God said to him: "The Lord has 
sworn and will not change his mind: 
'You are a priest forever.' " 

22 Because of this oath, Jesus has 
become the guarantee of a better 
covenant. 



For when there is a change of the 
priesthood, there must also be a change 
of the law. 

13 He of whom these things are said 
belonged to a different tribe, and no one 
from that tribe has ever served at the 
altar. 

14 For it is clear that our Lord descended 
from Judah, and in regard to that tribe 
Moses said nothing about priests. 

15 And what we have said is even more 
clear if another priest like Melchizedek 
appears, 

16 one who has become a priest not on 
the basis of a regulation as to his 
ancestry but on the basis of the power 
of an indestructible life. 

17 For it is declared: "You are a priest 
forever, in the order of Melchizedek." 

18 The former regulation is set aside 
because it was weak and useless 

19 (for the law made nothing perfect), and 
a better hope is introduced, by which we 
draw near to God. 



23 Now there have been many of those 
priests, since death prevented them 
from continuing in office; 

24 but because Jesus lives forever, he 
has a permanent priesthood. 

25 Therefore he is able to save 
completely those who come to God 
through him, because he always lives to 
intercede for them. 

26 Such a high priest meets our need- 
one who is holy, blameless, pure, set 
apart from sinners, exalted above the 
heavens. 

27 Unlike the other high priests, he does 
not need to offer sacrifices day after day, 
first for his own sins, and then for the 
sins of the people. He sacrificed for their 
sins once for all when he offered himself. 

28 For the law appoints as high priests 
men who are weak; but the oath, which 
came after the law, appointed the Son, 
who has been made perfect forever. 



8 



The point of what we are saying is 
this: We do have such a high priest, who 



sat down at the right hand of the throne 
of the Majesty in heaven, 

2 and who serves in the sanctuary, the 
true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not 
by man. 

3 Every high priest is appointed to offer 
both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was 
necessary for this one also to have 
something to offer. 

4 lf he were on earth, he would not be a 
priest, for there are already men who 
offer the gifts prescribed by the law. 

5 They serve at a sanctuary that is a 
copy and shadow of what is in heaven. 
This is why Moses was warned when he 
was about to build the tabernacle: "See 
to it that you make everything according 
to the pattern shown you on the 
mountain." 



because they did not remain faithful to 
my covenant, and I turned away from 
them, declares the Lord. 

10 This is the covenant I will make with 
the house of Israel after that time, 
declares the Lord. I will put my laws in 
their minds and write them on their 
hearts. I will be their God, and they will 
be my people. 

11 No longer will a man teach his 
neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 
'Know the Lord,' because they will all 
know me, from the least of them to the 
greatest. 

12 For I will forgive their wickedness and 
will remember their sins no more." 

13 By calling this covenant "new," he has 
made the first one obsolete; and what is 
obsolete and aging will soon disappear. 



But the ministry Jesus has received is 
as superior to theirs as the covenant of 
which he is mediator is superior to the 
old one, and it is founded on better 
promises. 

7 For if there had been nothing wrong 
with that first covenant, no place would 
have been sought for another. 

8 But God found fault with the people and 
said : "The time is coming, declares the 
Lord, when I will make a new covenant 
with the house of Israel and with the 
house of Judah. 

9 lt will not be like the covenant I made 
with their forefathers when I took them 
by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, 



9 Now the first covenant had 

regulations for worship and also an 
earthly sanctuary. 

2 A tabernacle was set up. In its first 
room were the lampstand, the table and 
the consecrated bread; this was called 
the Holy Place. 

3 Behind the second curtain was a room 
called the Most Holy Place, 

4 which had the golden altar of incense 
and the gold-covered ark of the 
covenant. This ark contained the gold 
jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had 
budded, and the stone tablets of the 
covenant. 



Above the ark were the cherubim of the 
Glory, overshadowing the atonement 
cover. But we cannot discuss these 
things in detail now. 



13 The blood of goats and bulls and the 
ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who 
are ceremonially unclean sanctify them 
so that they are outwardly clean. 



6 When everything had been arranged 
like this, the priests entered regularly 
into the outer room to carry on their 
ministry. 

7 But only the high priest entered the 
inner room, and that only once a year, 
and never without blood, which he 
offered for himself and for the sins the 
people had committed in ignorance. 

8 The Holy Spirit was showing by this 
that the way into the Most Holy Place 
had not yet been disclosed as long as 
the first tabernacle was still standing. 

9 This is an illustration for the present 
time, indicating that the gifts and 
sacrifices being offered were not able to 
clear the conscience of the worshiper. 

10 They are only a matter of food and 
drink and various ceremonial washings- 
external regulations applying until the 
time of the new order. 

"When Christ came as high priest of the 
good things that are already here, he 
went through the greater and more 
perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, 
that is to say, not a part of this creation. 

12 He did not enter by means of the blood 
of goats and calves; but he entered the 
Most Holy Place once for all by his own 
blood, having obtained eternal 
redemption. 



How much more, then, will the blood of 
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit 
offered himself unblemished to God, 
cleanse our consciences from acts that 
lead to death, so that we may serve the 
living God! 

15 For this reason Christ is the mediator 
of a new covenant, that those who are 
called may receive the promised eternal 
inheritance-now that he has died as a 
ransom to set them free from the sins 
committed under the first covenant. 

16 ln the case of a will, it is necessary to 
prove the death of the one who made it, 

17 because a will is in force only when 
somebody has died; it never takes effect 
while the one who made it is living. 

18 This is why even the first covenant 
was not put into effect without blood. 

19 When Moses had proclaimed every 
commandment of the law to all the 
people, he took the blood of calves, 
together with water, scarlet wool and 
branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the 
scroll and all the people. 

20 He said, "This is the blood of the 
covenant, which God has commanded 
you to keep." 

21 In the same way, he sprinkled with the 
blood both the tabernacle and 
everything used in its ceremonies. 



In fact, the law requires that nearly 
everything be cleansed with blood, and 
without the shedding of blood there is no 
forgiveness. 

23 lt was necessary, then, for the copies 
of the heavenly things to be purified with 
these sacrifices, but the heavenly things 
themselves with better sacrifices than 
these. 

24 For Christ did not enter a man-made 
sanctuary that was only a copy of the 
true one; he entered heaven itself, now 
to appear for us in God's presence. 

25 Nor did he enter heaven to offer 
himself again and again, the way the 
high priest enters the Most Holy Place 
every year with blood that is not his own. 

26 Then Christ would have had to suffer 
many times since the creation of the 
world. But now he has appeared once 
for all at the end of the ages to do away 
with sin by the sacrifice of himself. 

27 Just as man is destined to die once, 
and after that to face judgment, 

28 so Christ was sacrificed once to take 
away the sins of many people; and he 
will appear a second time, not to bear 
sin, but to bring salvation to those who 
are waiting for him. 



10 



"The law is only a shadow of the 

good things that are coming-not the 
realities themselves. For this reason it 
can never, by the same sacrifices 
repeated endlessly year after year, 



make perfect those who draw near to 
worship. 

2 lf it could, would they not have stopped 
being offered? For the worshipers would 
have been cleansed once for all, and 
would no longer have felt guilty for their 
sins. 

3 But those sacrifices are an annual 
reminder of sins, 

4 because it is impossible for the blood of 
bulls and goats to take away sins. 

therefore, when Christ came into the 
world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering 
you did not desire, but a body you 
prepared for me; 

6 with burnt offerings and sin offerings 
you were not pleased. 



7 Then I said, 'Here I 
about me in the scroll- 
do your will, O God.'" 



am-it is written 
- I have come to 



First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, 
burnt offerings and sin offerings you did 
not desire, nor were you pleased with 
them" (although the law required them 
to be made). 

9 Then he said, "Here I am, I have come 
to do your will." He sets aside the first to 
establish the second. 

10 And by that will, we have been made 
holy through the sacrifice of the body of 
Jesus Christ once for all. 

11 Day after day every priest stands and 
performs his religious duties; again and 



again he offers the same sacrifices, 
which can never take away sins. 

12 But when this priest had offered for all 
time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down 
at the right hand of God. 

13 Since that time he waits for his 
enemies to be made his footstool, 

14 because by one sacrifice he has made 
perfect forever those who are being 
made holy. 

15 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us 
about this. First he says: 

16 "This is the covenant I will make with 
them after that time, says the Lord. I will 
put my laws in their hearts, and I will 
write them on their minds." 

17 Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless 
acts I will remember no more." 



Let us hold unswervingly to the hope 
we profess, for he who promised is 
faithful. 

24 And let us consider how we may spur 
one another on toward love and good 
deeds. 

25 Let us not give up meeting together, 
as some are in the habit of doing, but let 
us encourage one another-and all the 
more as you see the Day approaching. 

26 lf we deliberately keep on sinning after 
we have received the knowledge of the 
truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, 

27 but only a fearful expectation of 
judgment and of raging fire that will 
consume the enemies of God. 

28 Anyone who rejected the law of Moses 
died without mercy on the testimony of 
two or three witnesses. 



18 And where these have been forgiven, 
there is no longer any sacrifice for sin. 

19 Therefore, brothers, since we have 
confidence to enter the Most Holy Place 
by the blood of Jesus, 

20 by a new and living way opened for us 
through the curtain, that is, his body, 

21 and since we have a great priest over 
the house of God, 

22 let us draw near to God with a sincere 
heart in full assurance of faith, having 
our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from 
a guilty conscience and having our 
bodies washed with pure water. 



How much more severely do you think 
a man deserves to be punished who has 
trampled the Son of God under foot, 
who has treated as an unholy thing the 
blood of the covenant that sanctified him, 
and who has insulted the Spirit of 
grace? 

30 For we know him who said, "It is mine 
to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The 
Lord will judge his people." 

31 It is a dreadful thing to fall into the 
hands of the living God. 

32 Remember those earlier days after 
you had received the light, when you 



stood your ground in a great contest in 
the face of suffering. 



so that what is seen was not made out 
of what was visible. 



Sometimes you were publicly exposed 
to insult and persecution; at other times 
you stood side by side with those who 
were so treated. 

34 You sympathized with those in prison 
and joyfully accepted the confiscation of 
your property, because you knew that 
you yourselves had better and lasting 
possessions. 

35 So do not throw away your confidence; 
it will be richly rewarded. 

36 You need to persevere so that when 
you have done the will of God, you will 
receive what he has promised. 

37 For in just a very little while, "He who 
is coming will come and will not delay. 

38 But my righteous one will live by faith. 
And if he shrinks back, I will not be 
pleased with him." 

39 But we are not of those who shrink 
back and are destroyed, but of those 
who believe and are saved. 



11 



Now faith is being sure of what we 

hope for and certain of what we do not 
see. 

2 This is what the ancients were 
commended for. 



By faith Abel offered God a better 
sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was 
commended as a righteous man, when 
God spoke well of his offerings. And by 
faith he still speaks, even though he is 
dead. 

5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, 
so that he did not experience death; he 
could not be found, because God had 
taken him away. For before he was 
taken, he was commended as one who 
pleased God. 

6 And without faith it is impossible to 
please God, because anyone who 
comes to him must believe that he 
exists and that he rewards those who 
earnestly seek him. 

7 By faith Noah, when warned about 
things not yet seen, in holy fear built an 
ark to save his family. By his faith he 
condemned the world and became heir 
of the righteousness that comes by faith. 

8 By faith Abraham, when called to go to 
a place he would later receive as his 
inheritance, obeyed and went, even 
though he did not know where he was 
going. 

9 By faith he made his home in the 
promised land like a stranger in a 
foreign country; he lived in tents, as did 
Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with 
him of the same promise. 



By faith we understand that the 
universe was formed at God's command, 



For he was looking forward to the city 
with foundations, whose architect and 
builder is God. 



Abraham reasoned that God could 
raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, 
he did receive Isaac back from death. 



11 By faith Abraham, even though he was 
past age-and Sarah herself was barren- 
-was enabled to become a father 
because he considered him faithful who 
had made the promise. 

12 And so from this one man, and he as 
good as dead, came descendants as 
numerous as the stars in the sky and as 
countless as the sand on the seashore. 

13 AII these people were still living by 
faith when they died. They did not 
receive the things promised; they only 
saw them and welcomed them from a 
distance. And they admitted that they 
were aliens and strangers on earth. 

14 People who say such things show that 
they are looking for a country of their 
own. 

15 lf they had been thinking of the country 
they had left, they would have had 
opportunity to return. 

16 lnstead, they were longing for a better 
country-a heavenly one. Therefore God 
is not ashamed to be called their God, 
for he has prepared a city for them. 

17 By faith Abraham, when God tested 
him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He 
who had received the promises was 
about to sacrifice his one and only son, 



20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau 
in regard to their future. 

21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, 
blessed each of Joseph's sons, and 
worshiped as he leaned on the top of his 
staff. 

22 By faith Joseph, when his end was 
near, spoke about the exodus of the 
Israelites from Egypt and gave 
instructions about his bones. 

23 By faith Moses' parents hid him for 
three months after he was born, 
because they saw he was no ordinary 
child, and they were not afraid of the 
king's edict. 

24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, 
refused to be known as the son of 
Pharaoh's daughter. 

25 He chose to be mistreated along with 
the people of God rather than to enjoy 
the pleasures of sin for a short time. 

26 He regarded disgrace for the sake of 
Christ as of greater value than the 
treasures of Egypt, because he was 
looking ahead to his reward. 

27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the 
king's anger; he persevered because he 
saw him who is invisible. 



even though God had said to him, "It is 
through Isaac that your offspring will be 
reckoned." 



28 By faith he kept the Passover and the 
sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer 



of the firstborn would not touch the 
firstborn of Israel. 

29 By faith the people passed through the 
Red Sea as on dry land; but when the 
Egyptians tried to do so, they were 
drowned. 

30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after 
the people had marched around them 
for seven days. 

31 By faith the prostitute Rahab, because 
she welcomed the spies, was not killed 
with those who were disobedient. 

32 And what more shall I say? I do not 
have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, 
Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and 
the prophets, 

33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, 
administered justice, and gained what 
was promised; who shut the mouths of 
lions, 



sword. They went about in sheepskins 
and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and 
mistreated- 

38 the world was not worthy of them. 
They wandered in deserts and 
mountains, and in caves and holes in 
the ground. 

39 These were all commended for their 
faith, yet none of them received what 
had been promised. 

40 God had planned something better for 
us so that only together with us would 
they be made perfect. 



12 



Therefore, since 



we 



are 



surrounded by such a great cloud of 
witnesses, let us throw off everything 
that hinders and the sin that so easily 
entangles, and let us run with 
perseverance the race marked out for 
us. 



34 quenched the fury of the flames, and 
escaped the edge of the sword; whose 
weakness was turned to strength; and 
who became powerful in battle and 
routed foreign armies. 

35 Women received back their dead, 
raised to life again. Others were tortured 
and refused to be released, so that they 
might gain a better resurrection. 

36 Some faced jeers and flogging, while 
still others were chained and put in 
prison. 

37 They were stoned ; they were sawed 
in two; they were put to death by the 



Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author 
and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy 
set before him endured the cross, 
scorning its shame, and sat down at the 
right hand of the throne of God. 

3 Consider him who endured such 
opposition from sinful men, so that you 
will not grow weary and lose heart. 

4 ln your struggle against sin, you have 
not yet resisted to the point of shedding 
your blood. 

5 And you have forgotten that word of 
encouragement that addresses you as 
sons: "My son, do not make light of the 



Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart 
when he rebukes you, 

6 because the Lord disciplines those he 
loves, and he punishes everyone he 
accepts as a son." 

7 Endure hardship as discipline; God is 
treating you as sons. For what son is not 
disciplined by his father? 

8 lf you are not disciplined (and everyone 
undergoes discipline), then you are 
illegitimate children and not true sons. 

9 Moreover, we have all had human 
fathers who disciplined us and we 
respected them for it. How much more 
should we submit to the Father of our 
spirits and live! 

10 Our fathers disciplined us for a little 
while as they thought best; but God 
disciplines us for our good, that we may 
share in his holiness. 

11 No discipline seems pleasant at the 
time, but painful. Later on, however, it 
produces a harvest of righteousness 
and peace for those who have been 
trained by it. 

12 Therefore, strengthen your feeble 
arms and weak knees. 

13 "Make level paths for your feet," so 
that the lame may not be disabled, but 
rather healed. 

14 Make every effort to live in peace with 
all men and to be holy; without holiness 
no one will see the Lord. 



15 See to it that no one misses the grace 
of God and that no bitter root grows up 
to cause trouble and defile many. 

16 See that no one is sexually immoral, or 
is godless like Esau, who for a single 
meal sold his inheritance rights as the 
oldest son. 

17 Afterward, as you know, when he 
wanted to inherit this blessing, he was 
rejected. He could bring about no 
change of mind, though he sought the 
blessing with tears. 

18 You have not come to a mountain that 
can be touched and that is burning with 
fire; to darkness, gloom and storm; 

19 to a trumpet blast or to such a voice 
speaking words that those who heard it 
begged that no further word be spoken 
to them, 

20 because they could not bear what was 
commanded: "If even an animal touches 
the mountain, it must be stoned." 

21 The sight was so terrifying that Moses 
said, "I am trembling with fear." 

22 But you have come to Mount Zion, to 
the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the 
living God. You have come to thousands 
upon thousands of angels in joyful 
assembly, 

23 to the church of the firstborn, whose 
names are written in heaven. You have 
come to God, the judge of all men, to 
the spirits of righteous men made 
perfect, 



to Jesus the mediator of a new 
covenant, and to the sprinkled blood 
that speaks a better word than the blood 
of Abel. 



Marriage should be honored by all, and 
the marriage bed kept pure, for God will 
judge the adulterer and all the sexually 
immoral. 



See to it that you do not refuse him 
who speaks. If they did not escape 
when they refused him who warned 
them on earth, how much less will we, if 
we turn away from him who warns us 
from heaven? 

26 At that time his voice shook the earth, 
but now he has promised, "Once more I 
will shake not only the earth but also the 
heavens." 

27 The words "once more" indicate the 
removing of what can be shaken-that is, 
created things-so that what cannot be 
shaken may remain. 

28 Therefore, since we are receiving a 
kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us 
be thankful, and so worship God 
acceptably with reverence and awe, 

29 for our "God is a consuming fire." 



13. 



â€¢ Keep on loving each other as 
brothers. 

2 Do not forget to entertain strangers, for 
by so doing some people have 
entertained angels without knowing it. 

3 Remember those in prison as if you 
were their fellow prisoners, and those 
who are mistreated as if you yourselves 
were suffering. 



Keep your lives free from the love of 
money and be content with what you 
have, because God has said, "Never will 
I leave you; never will I forsake you." 

6 So we say with confidence, "The Lord 
is my helper; I will not be afraid. What 
can man do to me?" 

7 Remember your leaders, who spoke 
the word of God to you. Consider the 
outcome of their way of life and imitate 
their faith. 

8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and 
today and forever. 

9 Do not be carried away by all kinds of 
strange teachings. It is good for our 
hearts to be strengthened by grace, not 
by ceremonial foods, which are of no 
value to those who eat them. 

10 We have an altar from which those 
who minister at the tabernacle have no 
right to eat. 

11 The high priest carries the blood of 
animals into the Most Holy Place as a 
sin offering, but the bodies are burned 
outside the camp. 

12 And so Jesus also suffered outside the 
city gate to make the people holy 
through his own blood. 

13 Let us, then, go to him outside the 
camp, bearing the disgrace he bore. 



14 For here we do not have an enduring 
city, but we are looking for the city that 
is to come. 

15 Through Jesus, therefore, let us 
continually offer to God a sacrifice of 
praise-the fruit of lips that confess his 
name. 

16 And do not forget to do good and to 
share with others, for with such 
sacrifices God is pleased. 

17 Obey your leaders and submit to their 
authority. They keep watch over you as 
men who must give an account. Obey 
them so that their work will be a joy, not 
a burden, for that would be of no 
advantage to you. 

18 Pray for us. We are sure that we have 
a clear conscience and desire to live 
honorably in every way. 

19 l particularly urge you to pray so that I 
may be restored to you soon. 



May the God of peace, who through 
the blood of the eternal covenant 
brought back from the dead our Lord 
Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, 

21 equip you with everything good for 
doing his will, and may he work in us 
what is pleasing to him, through Jesus 
Christ, to whom be glory for ever and 
ever. Amen. 

22 Brothers, I urge you to bear with my 
word of exhortation, for I have written 
you only a short letter. 

23 l want you to know that our brother 
Timothy has been released. If he arrives 
soon, I will come with him to see you. 

24 Greet all your leaders and all God's 
people. Those from Italy send you their 
greetings. 

25 Grace be with you all. 



James

James, a servant of God and of the 

Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes 
scattered among the nations: Greetings. 

2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers, 
whenever you face trials of many kinds, 

3 because you know that the testing of 
your faith develops perseverance. 

4 Perseverance must finish its work so 
that you may be mature and complete, 
not lacking anything. 

5 lf any of you lacks wisdom, he should 
ask God, who gives generously to all 
without finding fault, and it will be given 
to him. 

6 But when he asks, he must believe and 
not doubt, because he who doubts is 
like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed 
by the wind. 



'That man should not think he 
receive anything from the Lord; 



wil 



he is a double-minded man, unstable in 
all he does. 

9 The brother in humble circumstances 
ought to take pride in his high position. 

10 But the one who is rich should take 
pride in his low position, because he will 
pass away like a wild flower. 



For the sun rises with scorching heat 
and withers the plant; its blossom falls 
and its beauty is destroyed. In the same 
way, the rich man will fade away even 
while he goes about his business. 

12 Blessed is the man who perseveres 
under trial, because when he has stood 
the test, he will receive the crown of life 
that God has promised to those who 
love him. 

13 When tempted, no one should say, 
"God is tempting me." For God cannot 
be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt 
anyone; 

14 but each one is tempted when, by his 
own evil desire, he is dragged away and 
enticed. 

15 Then, after desire has conceived, it 
gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full- 
grown, gives birth to death. 



16 



Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. 

17 Every good and perfect gift is from 
above, coming down from the Father of 
the heavenly lights, who does not 
change like shifting shadows. 

18 He chose to give us birth through the 
word of truth, that we might be a kind of 
firstfruits of all he created. 

19 My dear brothers, take note of this: 
Everyone should be quick to listen, slow 
to speak and slow to become angry, 



20 for man's anger does not bring about 
the righteous life that God desires. 



clothes, and a poor man in shabby 
clothes also comes in. 



Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and 
the evil that is so prevalent and humbly 
accept the word planted in you, which 
can save you. 

22 Do not merely listen to the word, and 
so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 

23 Anyone who listens to the word but 
does not do what it says is like a man 
who looks at his face in a mirror 

24 and, after looking at himself, goes 
away and immediately forgets what he 
looks like. 

25 But the man who looks intently into the 
perfect law that gives freedom, and 
continues to do this, not forgetting what 
he has heard, but doing itâ€” he will be 
blessed in what he does. 

26 lf anyone considers himself religious 
and yet does not keep a tight rein on his 
tongue, he deceives himself and his 
religion is worthless. 

27 Religion that God our Father accepts 
as pure and faultless is this: to look after 
orphans and widows in their distress 
and to keep oneself from being polluted 
by the world. 



fcMy brothers, as believers in our 

glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show 
favoritism. 

2 Suppose a man comes into your 
meeting wearing a gold ring and fine 



If you show special attention to the man 
wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a 
good seat for you," but say to the poor 
man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the 
floor by my feet," 

4 have you not discriminated among 
yourselves and become judges with evil 
thoughts? 

5 Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God 
chosen those who are poor in the eyes 
of the world to be rich in faith and to 
inherit the kingdom he promised those 
who love him? 

6 But you have insulted the poor. Is it not 
the rich who are exploiting you? Are 
they not the ones who are dragging you 
into court? 

7 Are they not the ones who are 
slandering the noble name of him to 
whom you belong? 

8 lf you really keep the royal law found in 
Scripture, "Love your neighbor as 
yourself," you are doing right. 

9 But if you show favoritism, you sin and 
are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. 

10 For whoever keeps the whole law and 
yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of 
breaking all of it. 

11 For he who said, "Do not commit 
adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If 
you do not commit adultery but do 



commit murder, you have become a 
lawbreaker. 

12 Speak and act as those who are going 
to be judged by the law that gives 
freedom, 

13 because judgment without mercy will 
be shown to anyone who has not been 
merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment! 

14 What good is it, my brothers, if a man 
claims to have faith but has no deeds? 
Can such faith save him? 

15 Suppose a brother or sister is without 
clothes and daily food. 

16 lf one of you says to him, "Go, I wish 
you well; keep warm and well fed," but 
does nothing about his physical needs, 
what good is it? 

17 ln the same way, faith by itself, if it is 
not accompanied by action, is dead. 

18 But someone will say, "You have faith; 
I have deeds." 

19 Show me your faith without deeds, and 
I will show you my faith by what I do. 
You believe that there is one God. 
Good! Even the demons believe thatâ€” 
and shudder. 

20 You foolish man, do you want 
evidence that faith without deeds is 
useless ? 

21 Was not our ancestor Abraham 
considered righteous for what he did 
when he offered his son Isaac on the 
altar? 



You see that his faith and his actions 
were working together, and his faith was 
made complete by what he did. 

23 And the scripture was fulfilled that 
says, "Abraham believed God, and it 
was credited to him as righteousness," 
and he was called God's friend. 

24 You see that a person is justified by 
what he does and not by faith alone. 

25 ln the same way, was not even Rahab 
the prostitute considered righteous for 
what she did when she gave lodging to 
the spies and sent them off in a different 
direction? 

26 As the body without the spirit is dead, 
so faith without deeds is dead. 



ONot many of you should presume to 

be teachers, my brothers, because you 
know that we who teach will be judged 
more strictly. 

2 We all stumble in many ways. If anyone 
is never at fault in what he says, he is a 
perfect man, able to keep his whole 
body in check. 

3 When we put bits into the mouths of 
horses to make them obey us, we can 
turn the whole animal. 

4 Or take ships as an example. Although 
they are so large and are driven by 
strong winds, they are steered by a very 
small rudder wherever the pilot wants to 
go. 



5 Likewise the tongue is a small part of 
the body, but it makes great boasts. 
Consider what a great forest is set on 
fire by a small spark. 

6 The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil 
among the parts of the body. It corrupts 
the whole person, sets the whole course 
of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire 
by hell. 

7 AII kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and 
creatures of the sea are being tamed 
and have been tamed by man, 

8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a 
restless evil, full of deadly poison. 



Such "wisdom" does not come down 
from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, 
of the devil. 

16 For where you have envy and selfish 
ambition, there you find disorder and 
every evil practice. 

17 But the wisdom that comes from 
heaven is first of all pure; then peace- 
loving, considerate, submissive, full of 
mercy and good fruit, impartial and 
sincere. 

18 Peacemakers who sow in peace raise 
a harvest of righteousness. 



With the tongue we praise our Lord and 
Father, and with it we curse men, who 
have been made in God's likeness. 

10 Out of the same mouth come praise 
and cursing. My brothers, this should 
not be. 

"Can both fresh water and salt water 
flow from the same spring? 

12 My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, 
or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a 
salt spring produce fresh water. 

13 Who is wise and understanding among 
you? Let him show it by his good life, by 
deeds done in the humility that comes 
from wisdom. 

14 But if you harbor bitter envy and 
selfish ambition in your hearts, do not 
boast about it or deny the truth. 



tWhat causes fights and quarrels 

among you? Don't they come from your 
desires that battle within you? 

2 You want something but don't get it. 
You kill and covet, but you cannot have 
what you want. You quarrel and fight. 
You do not have, because you do not 
ask God. 

3 When you ask, you do not receive, 
because you ask with wrong motives, 
that you may spend what you get on 
your pleasures. 

4 You adulterous people, don't you know 
that friendship with the world is hatred 
toward God? Anyone who chooses to 
be a friend of the world becomes an 
enemy of God. 

5 0r do you think Scripture says without 
reason that the spirit he caused to live in 
us envies intensely? 



But he gives us more grace. That is 
why Scripture says: "God opposes the 
proud but gives grace to the humble." 



Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the 
Lord's will, we will live and do this or 
that." 



7 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist 
the devil, and he will flee from you. 



16 As it is, you boast and brag. All such 
boasting is evil. 



Come near to God and he will come 

near to you. Wash your hands, you 

sinners, and purify your hearts, you 
double-minded. 

9 Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your 
laughter to mourning and your joy to 
gloom. 

10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, 
and he will lift you up. 

"Brothers, do not slander one another. 
Anyone who speaks against his brother 
or judges him speaks against the law 
and judges it. When you judge the law, 
you are not keeping it, but sitting in 
judgment on it. 

12 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, 
the one who is able to save and destroy. 
But you-who are you to judge your 
neighbor? 

13 Now listen, you who say, "Today or 
tomorrow we will go to this or that city, 
spend a year there, carry on business 
and make money." 

14 Why, you do not even know what will 
happen tomorrow. What is your life? 
You are a mist that appears for a little 
while and then vanishes. 



17 Anyone, then, who knows the good he 
ought to do and doesn't do it, sins. 



^Now listen, you rich people, weep 

and wail because of the misery that is 
coming upon you. 

2 Your wealth has rotted, and moths 
have eaten your clothes. 

3 Your gold and silver are corroded. Their 
corrosion will testify against you and eat 
your flesh like fire. You have hoarded 
wealth in the last days. 

4 Look! The wages you failed to pay the 
workmen who mowed your fields are 
crying out against you. The cries of the 
harvesters have reached the ears of the 
Lord Almighty. 

5 You have lived on earth in luxury and 
self-indulgence. You have fattened 
yourselves in the day of slaughter. 

6 You have condemned and murdered 
innocent men, who were not opposing 
you. 

7 Be patient, then, brothers, until the 
Lord's coming. See how the farmer 
waits for the land to yield its valuable 
crop and how patient he is for the 
autumn and spring rains. 



8 You too, be patient and stand firm, 
because the Lord's coming is near. 



and anoint him with oil in the name of 
the Lord. 



Don't grumble against each other, 
brothers, or you will be judged. The 
Judge is standing at the door! 

10 Brothers, as an example of patience in 
the face of suffering, take the prophets 
who spoke in the name of the Lord. 

11 As you know, we consider blessed 
those who have persevered. You have 
heard of Job's perseverance and have 
seen what the Lord finally brought about. 
The Lord is full of compassion and 
mercy. 

12 Above all, my brothers, do not swear- 
not by heaven or by earth or by anything 
else. Let your "Yes" be yes, and your 
"No," no, or you will be condemned. 

13 ls any one of you in trouble? He 
should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him 
sing songs of praise. 

14 ls any one of you sick? He should call 
the elders of the church to pray over him 



15 And the prayer offered in faith will 
make the sick person well; the Lord will 
raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be 
forgiven. 

16 Therefore confess your sins to each 
other and pray for each other so that 
you may be healed. The prayer of a 
righteous man is powerful and effective. 

17 Elijah was a man just like us. He 
prayed earnestly that it would not rain, 
and it did not rain on the land for three 
and a half years. 

18 Again he prayed, and the heavens 
gave rain, and the earth produced its 
crops. 

19 My brothers, if one of you should 
wander from the truth and someone 
should bring him back, 

20 remember this: Whoever turns a 
sinner from the error of his way will save 
him from death and cover over a 
multitude of sins. 



1st Peter 



1 



Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To 

God's elect, strangers in the world, 
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, 
Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 

2 who have been chosen according to 
the foreknowledge of God the Father, 
through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, 
for obedience to Jesus Christ and 
sprinkling by his blood: Grace and 
peace be yours in abundance. 

3 Praise be to the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he 
has given us new birth into a living hope 
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ 
from the dead, 

4 and into an inheritance that can never 
perish, spoil or fade-kept in heaven for 
you, 

5 who through faith are shielded by God's 
power until the coming of the salvation 
that is ready to be revealed in the last 
time. 

6 ln this you greatly rejoice, though now 
for a little while you may have had to 
suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 

7 These have come so that your faithâ€” of 
greater worth than gold, which perishes 
even though refined by fire-may be 
proved genuine and may result in praise, 
glory and honor when Jesus Christ is 
revealed. 



Though you have not seen him, you 
love him; and even though you do not 
see him now, you believe in him and are 
filled with an inexpressible and glorious 
joy, 

9 for you are receiving the goal of your 
faith, the salvation of your souls. 

10 Concerning this salvation, the 
prophets, who spoke of the grace that 
was to come to you, searched intently 
and with the greatest care, 

"trying to find out the time and 
circumstances to which the Spirit of 
Christ in them was pointing when he 
predicted the sufferings of Christ and 
the glories that would follow. 

12 lt was revealed to them that they were 
not serving themselves but you, when 
they spoke of the things that have now 
been told you by those who have 
preached the gospel to you by the Holy 
Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels 
long to look into these things. 

13 Therefore, prepare your minds for 
action; be self-controlled; set your hope 
fully on the grace to be given you when 
Jesus Christ is revealed. 

14 As obedient children, do not conform 
to the evil desires you had when you 
lived in ignorance. 

15 But just as he who called you is holy, 
so be holy in all you do; 



16 for it is written: "Be holy, because I am 
holy." 

17 Since you call on a Father who judges 
each man's work impartially, live your 
lives as strangers here in reverent fear. 

18 For you know that it was not with 
perishable things such as silver or gold 
that you were redeemed from the empty 
way of life handed down to you from 
your forefathers, 

19 but with the precious blood of Christ, a 
lamb without blemish or defect. 

20 He was chosen before the creation of 
the world, but was revealed in these last 
times for your sake. 

21 Through him you believe in God, who 
raised him from the dead and glorified 
him, and so your faith and hope are in 
God. 

22 Now that you have purified yourselves 
by obeying the truth so that you have 
sincere love for your brothers, love one 
another deeply, from the heart. 

23 For you have been born again, not of 
perishable seed, but of imperishable, 
through the living and enduring word of 
God. 

24 For, "All men are like grass, and all 
their glory is like the flowers of the field; 
the grass withers and the flowers fall, 

25 but the word of the Lord stands 
forever." And this is the word that was 
preached to you. 



^Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice 

and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and 
slander of every kind. 

2 Like newborn babies, crave pure 
spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow 
up in your salvation, 

3 now that you have tasted that the Lord 
is good. 

4 As you come to him, the living Stone- 
rejected by men but chosen by God and 
precious to him- 

5 you also, like living stones, are being 
built into a spiritual house to be a holy 
priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices 
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 

6 For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a 
stone in Zion, a chosen and precious 
cornerstone, and the one who trusts in 
him will never be put to shame." 

7 Now to you who believe, this stone is 
precious. But to those who do not 
believe, "The stone the builders rejected 
has become the capstone, " 

8 and, "A stone that causes men to 
stumble and a rock that makes them 
fall." They stumble because they 
disobey the message-which is also 
what they were destined for. 

9 But you are a chosen people, a royal 
priesthood, a holy nation, a people 
belonging to God, that you may declare 
the praises of him who called you out of 
darkness into his wonderful light. 



10 Once you were not a people, but now 
you are the people of God; once you 
had not received mercy, but now you 
have received mercy. 

"Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and 
strangers in the world, to abstain from 
sinful desires, which war against your 
soul. 



For it is commendable if a man bears 
up under the pain of unjust suffering 
because he is conscious of God. 

20 But how is it to your credit if you 
receive a beating for doing wrong and 
endure it? But if you suffer for doing 
good and you endure it, this is 
commendable before God. 



Live such good lives among the 
pagans that, though they accuse you of 
doing wrong, they may see your good 
deeds and glorify God on the day he 
visits us. 

13 Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake 
to every authority instituted among men: 
whether to the king, as the supreme 
authority, 

14 or to governors, who are sent by him 
to punish those who do wrong and to 
commend those who do right. 

15 For it is God's will that by doing good 
you should silence the ignorant talk of 
foolish men. 



To this you were called, because 
Christ suffered for you, leaving you an 
example, that you should follow in his 
steps. 

22 "He committed no sin, and no deceit 
was found in his mouth." 

23 When they hurled their insults at him, 
he did not retaliate; when he suffered, 
he made no threats. Instead, he 
entrusted himself to him who judges 
justly. 

24 He himself bore our sins in his body on 
the tree, so that we might die to sins and 
live for righteousness; by his wounds 
you have been healed. 



Live as free men, but do not use your 
freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as 
servants of God. 



For you were like sheep going astray, 
but now you have returned to the 
Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. 



Show proper respect to everyone: 
Love the brotherhood of believers, fear 
God, honor the king. 

18 Slaves, submit yourselves to your 
masters with all respect, not only to 
those who are good and considerate, 
but also to those who are harsh. 



OWives, in the same way be 

submissive to your husbands so that, if 
any of them do not believe the word, 
they may be won over without words by 
the behavior of their wives, 

2 when they see the purity and reverence 
of your lives. 



Your beauty should not come from 
outward adornment, such as braided 
hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and 
fine clothes. 



instead, it should be that of your inner wnu is yumy iu 

self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and eager to do good? 
quiet spirit, which is of great worth in 
God's sight. 



For the eyes of the Lord are on the 
righteous and his ears are attentive to 
their prayer, but the face of the Lord is 
against those who do evil." 

13 Who is going to harm you if you are 

a^r\c^v \n> r\n> r\r\r\r\0 



Â°For this is the way the holy women of 
the past who put their hope in God used 
to make themselves beautiful. They 
were submissive to their own husbands, 

6 like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and 
called him her master. You are her 
daughters if you do what is right and do 
not give way to fear. 

7 Husbands, in the same way be 
considerate as you live with your wives, 
and treat them with respect as the 
weaker partner and as heirs with you of 
the gracious gift of life, so that nothing 
will hinder your prayers. 

8 Finally, all of you, live in harmony with 
one another; be sympathetic, love as 
brothers, be compassionate and humble. 

9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with 
insult, but with blessing, because to this 
you were called so that you may inherit 
a blessing. 

10 For, "Whoever would love life and see 
good days must keep his tongue from 
evil and his lips from deceitful speech. 

11 He must turn from evil and do good; 
he must seek peace and pursue it. 



But even if you should suffer for what 
is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear 
what they fear ; do not be frightened." 

15 But in your hearts set apart Christ as 
Lord. Always be prepared to give an 
answer to everyone who asks you to 
give the reason for the hope that you 
have. But do this with gentleness and 
respect, 

16 keeping a clear conscience, so that 
those who speak maliciously against 
your good behavior in Christ may be 
ashamed of their slander. 

17 lt is better, if it is God's will, to suffer 
for doing good than for doing evil. 

18 For Christ died for sins once for all, the 
righteous for the unrighteous, to bring 
you to God. He was put to death in the 
body but made alive by the Spirit, 

19 through whom also he went and 
preached to the spirits in prison 

20 who disobeyed long ago when God 
waited patiently in the days of Noah 
while the ark was being built. In it only a 
few people, eight in all, were saved 
through water, 

21 and this water symbolizes baptism that 
now saves you also-not the removal of 



dirt from the body but the pledge of a 
good conscience toward God. It saves 
you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 



Above all, love each other deeply, 
because love covers over a multitude of 
sins. 



who has gone into heaven and is at 
God's right hand-with angels, 
authorities and powers in submission to 
him. 



^â™¦Therefore, since Christ suffered in his 

body, arm yourselves also with the 
same attitude, because he who has 
suffered in his body is done with sin. 

2 As a result, he does not live the rest of 
his earthly life for evil human desires, 
but rather for the will of God. 

3 For you have spent enough time in the 
past doing what pagans choose to do- 
living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, 
orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. 

4 They think it strange that you do not 
plunge with them into the same flood of 
dissipation, and they heap abuse on you. 

5 But they will have to give account to 
him who is ready to judge the living and 
the dead. 

6 For this is the reason the gospel was 
preached even to those who are now 
dead, so that they might be judged 
according to men in regard to the body, 
but live according to God in regard to 
the spirit. 

7 The end of all things is near. Therefore 
be clear minded and self-controlled so 
that you can pray. 



9 Offer hospitality to one another without 
grumbling. 

10 Each one should use whatever gift he 
has received to serve others, faithfully 
administering God's grace in its various 
forms. 

11 If anyone speaks, he should do it as 
one speaking the very words of God. If 
anyone serves, he should do it with the 
strength God provides, so that in all 
things God may be praised through 
Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and 
the power for ever and ever. Amen. 

12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at 
the painful trial you are suffering, as 
though something strange were 
happening to you. 

13 But rejoice that you participate in the 
sufferings of Christ, so that you may be 
overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 

14 lf you are insulted because of the 
name of Christ, you are blessed, for the 
Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 

15 lf you suffer, it should not be as a 
murderer or thief or any other kind of 
criminal, or even as a meddler. 

16 However, if you suffer as a Christian, 
do not be ashamed, but praise God that 
you bear that name. 

17 For it is time for judgment to begin with 
the family of God; and if it begins with us, 



what will the outcome be for those who 
do not obey the gospel of God? 

18 And, "If it is hard for the righteous to 
be saved, what will become of the 
ungodly and the sinner?" 



Humble yourselves, therefore, under 
God's mighty hand, that he may lift you 
up in due time. 

7 Cast all your anxiety on him because 
he cares for you. 



So then, those who suffer according to 
God's will should commit themselves to 
their faithful Creator and continue to do 
good. 



Be self-controlled and alert. Your 
enemy the devil prowls around like a 
roaring lion looking for someone to 
devour. 



^To the elders among you, I appeal as 

a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's 
sufferings and one who also will share in 
the glory to be revealed: 

2 Be shepherds of God's flock that is 
under your care, serving as overseers- 
not because you must, but because you 
are willing, as God wants you to be; not 
greedy for money, but eager to serve; 

3 not lording it over those entrusted to 
you, but being examples to the flock. 

4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, 
you will receive the crown of glory that 
will never fade away. 

5 Young men, in the same way be 
submissive to those who are older. All of 
you, clothe yourselves with humility 
toward one another, because, "God 
opposes the proud but gives grace to 
the humble." 



Resist him, standing firm in the faith, 
because you know that your brothers 
throughout the world are undergoing the 
same kind of sufferings. 

10 And the God of all grace, who called 
you to his eternal glory in Christ, after 
you have suffered a little while, will 
himself restore you and make you 
strong, firm and steadfast. 

11 To him be the power for ever and ever. 
Amen. 

12 With the help of Silas, whom I regard 
as a faithful brother, I have written to 
you briefly, encouraging you and 
testifying that this is the true grace of 
God. Stand fast in it. 

13 She who is in Babylon, chosen 
together with you, sends you her 
greetings, and so does my son Mark. 

14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. 
Peace to all of you who are in Christ. 



2nd Peter 



1 



Simon Peter, a servant and apostle 

of Jesus Christ, To those who through 
the righteousness of our God and Savior 
Jesus Christ have received a faith as 
precious as ours: 

2 Grace and peace be yours in 
abundance through the knowledge of 
God and of Jesus our Lord. 

3 His divine power has given us 
everything we need for life and 
godliness through our knowledge of him 
who called us by his own glory and 
goodness. 

4 Through these he has given us his very 
great and precious promises, so that 
through them you may participate in the 
divine nature and escape the corruption 
in the world caused by evil desires. 

5 For this very reason, make every effort 
to add to your faith goodness; and to 
goodness, knowledge; 

6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to 
self-control, perseverance; and to 
perseverance, godliness; 

7 and to godliness, brotherly kindness; 
and to brotherly kindness, love. 

8 For if you possess these qualities in 
increasing measure, they will keep you 
from being ineffective and unproductive 



in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

9 But if anyone does not have them, he is 
nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten 
that he has been cleansed from his past 
sins. 

10 Therefore, my brothers, be all the 
more eager to make your calling and 
election sure. For if you do these things, 
you will never fall, 

"and you will receive a rich welcome 
into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. 

12 So I will always remind you of these 
things, even though you know them and 
are firmly established in the truth you 
now have. 

13 l think it is right to refresh your 
memory as long as I live in the tent of 
this body, 

14 because I know that I will soon put it 
aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has 
made clear to me. 

15 And I will make every effort to see that 
after my departure you will always be 
able to remember these things. 

16 We did not follow cleverly invented 
stories when we told you about the 
power and coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his 
majesty. 



For he received honor and glory from 
God the Father when the voice came to 
him from the Majestic Glory, saying, 
"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I 
am well pleased." 

18 We ourselves heard this voice that 
came from heaven when we were with 
him on the sacred mountain. 

19 And we have the word of the prophets 
made more certain, and you will do well 
to pay attention to it, as to a light shining 
in a dark place, until the day dawns and 
the morning star rises in your hearts. 

20 Above all, you must understand that 
no prophecy of Scripture came about by 
the prophet's own interpretation. 



4 For if God did not spare angels when 
they sinned, but sent them to hell, 
putting them into gloomy dungeons to 
be held for judgment; 

5 if he did not spare the ancient world 
when he brought the flood on its 
ungodly people, but protected Noah, a 
preacher of righteousness, and seven 
others; 

6 if he condemned the cities of Sodom 
and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, 
and made them an example of what is 
going to happen to the ungodly; 

7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, 
who was distressed by the filthy lives of 
lawless men 



21 For prophecy never had its origin in 
the will of man, but men spoke from God 
as they were carried along by the Holy 
Spirit. 



8 (for that righteous man, living among 
them day after day, was tormented in 
his righteous soul by the lawless deeds 
he saw and heard)- 



fcBut there were also false prophets 

among the people, just as there will be 
false teachers among you. They will 
secretly introduce destructive heresies, 
even denying the sovereign Lord who 
bought them-bringing swift destruction 
on themselves. 



if this is so, then the Lord knows how to 
rescue godly men from trials and to hold 
the unrighteous for the day of judgment, 
while continuing their punishment. 

10 This is especially true of those who 
follow the corrupt desire of the sinful 
nature and despise authority. 



2 Many will follow their shameful ways 
and will bring the way of truth into 
disrepute. 

3 ln their greed these teachers will exploit 
you with stories they have made up. 
Their condemnation has long been 
hanging over them, and their destruction 
has not been sleeping. 



"Bold and arrogant, these men are not 
afraid to slander celestial beings; yet 
even angels, although they are stronger 
and more powerful, do not bring 
slanderous accusations against such 
beings in the presence of the Lord. 

12 But these men blaspheme in matters 
they do not understand. They are like 



brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born 
only to be caught and destroyed, and 
like beasts they too will perish. 

13 They will be paid back with harm for 
the harm they have done. Their idea of 
pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. 
They are blots and blemishes, reveling 
in their pleasures while they feast with 
you. 

14 With eyes full of adultery, they never 
stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; 
they are experts in greed-an accursed 
brood! 

15 They have left the straight way and 
wandered off to follow the way of 
Balaam son of Beor, who loved the 
wages of wickedness. 

16 But he was rebuked for his 
wrongdoing by a donkey-a beast 
without speech-who spoke with a man's 
voice and restrained the prophet's 
madness. 

17 These men are springs without water 
and mists driven by a storm. Blackest 
darkness is reserved for them. 

18 For they mouth empty, boastful words 
and, by appealing to the lustful desires 
of sinful human nature, they entice 
people who are just escaping from those 
who live in error. 

19 They promise them freedom, while 
they themselves are slaves of depravity- 
-for a man is a slave to whatever has 
mastered him. 



20 lf they have escaped the corruption of 
the world by knowing our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ and are again 
entangled in it and overcome, they are 
worse off at the end than they were at 
the beginning. 

21 It would have been better for them not 
to have known the way of righteousness, 
than to have known it and then to turn 
their backs on the sacred command that 
was passed on to them. 

22 0f them the proverbs are true: "A dog 
returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is 
washed goes back to her wallowing in 
the mud." 



ODear friends, this is now my second 
letter to you. I have written both of them 
as reminders to stimulate you to 
wholesome thinking. 

2 I want you to recall the words spoken in 
the past by the holy prophets and the 
command given by our Lord and Savior 
through your apostles. 

3 First of all, you must understand that in 
the last days scoffers will come, scoffing 
and following their own evil desires. 

4 They will say, "Where is this 'coming' 
he promised? Ever since our fathers 
died, everything goes on as it has since 
the beginning of creation." 

5 But they deliberately forget that long 
ago by God's word the heavens existed 
and the earth was formed out of water 
and by water. 



By these waters also the world of that 
time was deluged and destroyed. 

7 By the same word the present heavens 
and earth are reserved for fire, being 
kept for the day of judgment and 
destruction of ungodly men. 

8 But do not forget this one thing, dear 
friends: With the Lord a day is like a 
thousand years, and a thousand years 
are like a day. 

9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his 
promise, as some understand slowness. 
He is patient with you, not wanting 
anyone to perish, but everyone to come 
to repentance. 

10 But the day of the Lord will come like a 
thief. The heavens will disappear with a 
roar; the elements will be destroyed by 
fire, and the earth and everything in it 
will be laid bare. 

"Since everything will be destroyed in 
this way, what kind of people ought you 
to be? You ought to live holy and godly 
lives 

12 as you look forward to the day of God 
and speed its coming. That day will 
bring about the destruction of the 
heavens by fire, and the elements will 
melt in the heat. 



13 But in keeping with his promise we are 
looking forward to a new heaven and a 
new earth, the home of righteousness. 

14 So then, dear friends, since you are 
looking forward to this, make every 
effort to be found spotless, blameless 
and at peace with him. 

15 Bear in mind that our Lord's patience 
means salvation, just as our dear 
brother Paul also wrote you with the 
wisdom that God gave him. 

16 He writes the same way in all his 
letters, speaking in them of these 
matters. His letters contain some things 
that are hard to understand, which 
ignorant and unstable people distort, as 
they do the other Scriptures, to their 
own destruction. 

17 Therefore, dear friends, since you 
already know this, be on your guard so 
that you may not be carried away by the 
error of lawless men and fall from your 
secure position. 

18 But grow in the grace and knowledge 
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To 
him be glory both now and forever! 
Amen. 



1st John 



1 



That which was from the beginning, 

which we have heard, which we have 
seen with our eyes, which we have 
looked at and our hands have touched- 
this we proclaim concerning the Word of 
life. 

2 The life appeared; we have seen it and 
testify to it, and we proclaim to you the 
eternal life, which was with the Father 
and has appeared to us. 

3 We proclaim to you what we have seen 
and heard, so that you also may have 
fellowship with us. And our fellowship is 
with the Father and with his Son, Jesus 
Christ. 

4 We write this to make our joy complete. 



9 lf we confess our sins, he is faithful and 
just and will forgive us our sins and 
purify us from all unrighteousness. 

10 lf we claim we have not sinned, we 
make him out to be a liar and his word 
has no place in our lives. 



fcMy dear children, I write this to you 

so that you will not sin. But if anybody 
does sin, we have one who speaks to 
the Father in our defense-Jesus Christ, 
the Righteous One. 

2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, 
and not only for ours but also for the 
sins of the whole world. 

3 We know that we have come to know 
him if we obey his commands. 



Â°This is the message we have heard 
from him and declare to you: God is 
light; in him there is no darkness at all. 

6 lf we claim to have fellowship with him 
yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do 
not live by the truth. 

7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in 
the light, we have fellowship with one 
another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, 
purifies us from all sin. 

8 lf we claim to be without sin, we 
deceive ourselves and the truth is not in 
us. 



The man who says, "I know him," but 
does not do what he commands is a liar, 
and the truth is not in him. 

5 But if anyone obeys his word, God's 
love is truly made complete in him. This 
is how we know we are in him: 

6 Whoever claims to live in him must 
walk as Jesus did. 

7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new 
command but an old one, which you 
have had since the beginning. This old 
command is the message you have 
heard. 



Yet I am writing you a new command; 
its truth is seen in him and you, because 
the darkness is passing and the true 
light is already shining. 

9 Anyone who claims to be in the light but 
hates his brother is still in the darkness. 

10 Whoever loves his brother lives in the 
light, and there is nothing in him to make 
him stumble. 

11 But whoever hates his brother is in the 
darkness and walks around in the 
darkness; he does not know where he is 
going, because the darkness has 
blinded him. 

12 l write to you, dear children, because 
your sins have been forgiven on account 
of his name. 

13 l write to you, fathers, because you 
have known him who is from the 
beginning. I write to you, young men, 
because you have overcome the evil 
one. I write to you, dear children, 
because you have known the Father. 

14 l write to you, fathers, because you 
have known him who is from the 
beginning. I write to you, young men, 
because you are strong, and the word of 
God lives in you, and you have 
overcome the evil one. 

15 Do not love the world or anything in 
the world. If anyone loves the world, the 
love of the Father is not in him. 

16 For everything in the world-the 
cravings of sinful man, the lust of his 
eyes and the boasting of what he has 



and does-comes not from the Father 
but from the world. 

17 The world and its desires pass away, 
but the man who does the will of God 
lives forever. 

18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and 
as you have heard that the antichrist is 
coming, even now many antichrists 
have come. This is how we know it is 
the last hour. 

19 They went out from us, but they did 
not really belong to us. For if they had 
belonged to us, they would have 
remained with us; but their going 
showed that none of them belonged to 
us. 

20 But you have an anointing from the 
Holy One, and all of you know the truth. 

21 1 do not write to you because you do 
not know the truth, but because you do 
know it and because no lie comes from 
the truth. 

22 Who is the liar? It is the man who 
denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a 
man is the antichrist-he denies the 
Father and the Son. 

23 No one who denies the Son has the 
Father; whoever acknowledges the Son 
has the Father also. 

24 See that what you have heard from the 
beginning remains in you. If it does, you 
also will remain in the Son and in the 
Father. 



And this is what he promised us-even 
eternal life. 

26 l am writing these things to you about 
those who are trying to lead you astray. 

27 As for you, the anointing you received 
from him remains in you, and you do not 
need anyone to teach you. But as his 
anointing teaches you about all things 
and as that anointing is real, not 
counterfeit-just as it has taught you, 
remain in him. 

28 And now, dear children, continue in 
him, so that when he appears we may 
be confident and unashamed before him 
at his coming. 

29 lf you know that he is righteous, you 
know that everyone who does what is 
right has been born of him. 



But you know that he appeared so that 
he might take away our sins. And in him 
is no sin. 

6 No one who lives in him keeps on 
sinning. No one who continues to sin 
has either seen him or known him. 

7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead 
you astray. He who does what is right is 
righteous, just as he is righteous. 

8 He who does what is sinful is of the 
devil, because the devil has been 
sinning from the beginning. The reason 
the Son of God appeared was to destroy 
the devil's work. 

9 No one who is born of God will continue 
to sin, because God's seed remains in 
him; he cannot go on sinning, because 
he has been born of God. 



OHow great is the love the Father has 

lavished on us, that we should be called 
children of God! And that is what we 
are! The reason the world does not 
know us is that it did not know him. 

2 Dear friends, now we are children of 
God, and what we will be has not yet 
been made known. But we know that 
when he appears, we shall be like him, 
for we shall see him as he is. 

3 Everyone who has this hope in him 
purifies himself, just as he is pure. 

4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in 
fact, sin is lawlessness. 



This is how we know who the children 
of God are and who the children of the 
devil are: Anyone who does not do what 
is right is not a child of God; nor is 
anyone who does not love his brother. 

"This is the message you heard from 
the beginning: We should love one 
another. 

12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to 
the evil one and murdered his brother. 
And why did he murder him? Because 
his own actions were evil and his 
brother's were righteous. 

13 Do not be surprised, my brothers, if 
the world hates you. 



We know that we have passed from 
death to life, because we love our 
brothers. Anyone who does not love 
remains in death. 



Those who obey his commands live in 
him, and he in them. And this is how we 
know that he lives in us: We know it by 
the Spirit he gave us. 



15 Anyone who hates his brother is a 
murderer, and you know that no 
murderer has eternal life in him. 

16 This is how we know what love is: 
Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. 
And we ought to lay down our lives for 
our brothers. 

17 lf anyone has material possessions 
and sees his brother in need but has no 
pity on him, how can the love of God be 
in him? 

18 Dear children, let us not love with 
words or tongue but with actions and in 
truth. 

19 This then is how we know that we 
belong to the truth, and how we set our 
hearts at rest in his presence 



TDear friends, do not believe every 

spirit, but test the spirits to see whether 
they are from God, because many false 
prophets have gone out into the world. 

2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit 
of God: Every spirit that acknowledges 
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh 
is from God, 

3 but every spirit that does not 
acknowledge Jesus is not from God. 
This is the spirit of the antichrist, which 
you have heard is coming and even now 
is already in the world. 

4 You, dear children, are from God and 
have overcome them, because the one 
who is in you is greater than the one 
who is in the world. 



whenever our hearts condemn us. For 
God is greater than our hearts, and he 
knows everything. 



They are from the world and therefore 
speak from the viewpoint of the world, 
and the world listens to them. 



Dear friends, if our hearts do not 
condemn us, we have confidence before 
God 

22 and receive from him anything we ask, 
because we obey his commands and do 
what pleases him. 

23 And this is his command: to believe in 
the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and 
to love one another as he commanded 
us. 



We are from God, and whoever knows 
God listens to us; but whoever is not 
from God does not listen to us. This is 
how we recognize the Spirit of truth and 
the spirit of falsehood. 

7 Dear friends, let us love one another, 
for love comes from God. Everyone who 
loves has been born of God and knows 
God. 



Whoever does not love does not know 
God, because God is love. 

9 This is how God showed his love 
among us: He sent his one and only 
Son into the world that we might live 
through him. 

10 This is love: not that we loved God, but 
that he loved us and sent his Son as an 
atoning sacrifice for our sins. 

"Dear friends, since God so loved us, 
we also ought to love one another. 



do with punishment. The one who fears 
is not made perfect in love. 

19 We love because he first loved us. 

20 lf anyone says, "I love God," yet hates 
his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who 
does not love his brother, whom he has 
seen, cannot love God, whom he has 
not seen. 

21 And he has given us this command: 
Whoever loves God must also love his 
brother. 



No one has ever seen God; but if we 
love one another, God lives in us and 
his love is made complete in us. 

13 We know that we live in him and he in 
us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 

14 And we have seen and testify that the 
Father has sent his Son to be the Savior 
of the world. 

15 lf anyone acknowledges that Jesus is 
the Son of God, God lives in him and he 
in God. 

16 And so we know and rely on the love 
God has for us. God is love. Whoever 



lives in love lives in God, 
him. 



and God in 



17 



In this way, love is made complete 
among us so that we will have 
confidence on the day of judgment, 
because in this world we are like him. 

18 There is no fear in love. But perfect 
love drives out fear, because fear has to 



^Everyone who believes that Jesus is 

the Christ is born of God, and everyone 
who loves the father loves his child as 
well. 

2 This is how we know that we love the 
children of God: by loving God and 
carrying out his commands. 

3 This is love for God: to obey his 
commands. And his commands are not 
burdensome, 

4 for everyone born of God overcomes 
the world. This is the victory that has 
overcome the world, even our faith. 

5 Who is it that overcomes the world? 
Only he who believes that Jesus is the 
Son of God. 

6 This is the one who came by water and 
blood-Jesus Christ. He did not come by 
water only, but by water and blood. And 
it is the Spirit who testifies, because the 
Spirit is the truth. 



7 For there are three that testify: 

8 the Spirit, the water and the blood; and 
the three are in agreement. 

9 We accept man's testimony, but God's 
testimony is greater because it is the 
testimony of God, which he has given 
about his Son. 

10 Anyone who believes in the Son of 
God has this testimony in his heart. 
Anyone who does not believe God has 
made him out to be a liar, because he 
has not believed the testimony God has 
given about his Son. 

"And this is the testimony: God has 
given us eternal life, and this life is in his 
Son. 

12 He who has the Son has life; he who 
does not have the Son of God does not 
have life. 

13 l write these things to you who believe 
in the name of the Son of God so that 
you may know that you have eternal life. 

14 This is the confidence we have in 
approaching God: that if we ask 
anything according to his will, he hears 
us. 



And if we know that he hears us- 
whatever we ask-we know that we have 
what we asked of him. 

16 lf anyone sees his brother commit a 
sin that does not lead to death, he 
should pray and God will give him life. I 
refer to those whose sin does not lead 
to death. There is a sin that leads to 
death. I am not saying that he should 
pray about that. 

17 AII wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin 
that does not lead to death. 

18 We know that anyone born of God 
does not continue to sin; the one who 
was born of God keeps him safe, and 
the evil one cannot harm him. 

19 We know that we are children of God, 
and that the whole world is under the 
control of the evil one. 

20 We know also that the Son of God has 
come and has given us understanding, 
so that we may know him who is true. 
And we are in him who is true-even in 
his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God 
and eternal life. 

21 Dear children, keep yourselves from 
idols. 



2nd John 



1 



The elder, 



2 To the chosen lady and her children, 
whom I love in the truth-and not I only, 
but also all who know the truthâ€” 
because of the truth, which lives in us 
and will be with us forever: 

3 Grace, mercy and peace from God the 
Father and from Jesus Christ, the 
Father's Son, will be with us in truth and 
love. 

4 lt has given me great joy to find some 
of your children walking in the truth, just 
as the Father commanded us. 

5 And now, dear lady, I am not writing 
you a new command but one we have 
had from the beginning. I ask that we 
love one another. 

6 And this is love: that we walk in 
obedience to his commands. As you 
have heard from the beginning, his 
command is that you walk in love. 



7 Many deceivers, who do not 
acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in 
the flesh, have gone out into the world. 
Any such person is the deceiver and the 
antichrist. 

8 Watch out that you do not lose what 
you have worked for, but that you may 
be rewarded fully. 

9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not 
continue in the teaching of Christ does 
not have God; whoever continues in the 
teaching has both the Father and the 
Son. 

10 lf anyone comes to you and does not 
bring this teaching, do not take him into 
your house or welcome him. 

"Anyone who welcomes him shares in 
his wicked work. 

12 l have much to write to you, but I do 
not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I 
hope to visit you and talk with you face 
to face, so that our joy may be complete. 

13 The children of your chosen sister 
send their greetings. 



3rd John 



1 



The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, 
whom I love in the truth. 

2 Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy 
good health and that all may go well 
with you, even as your soul is getting 
along well. 

3 lt gave me great joy to have some 
brothers come and tell about your 
faithfulness to the truth and how you 
continue to walk in the truth. 

4 I have no greater joy than to hear that 
my children are walking in the truth. 

5 Dear friend, you are faithful in what you 
are doing for the brothers, even though 
they are strangers to you. 

6 They have told the church about your 
love. You will do well to send them on 
their way in a manner worthy of God. 

7 lt was for the sake of the Name that 
they went out, receiving no help from 
the pagans. 



We ought therefore to show hospitality 
to such men so that we may work 
together for the truth. 

9 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, 
who loves to be first, will have nothing to 
do with us. 

10 So if I come, I will call attention to what 
he is doing, gossiping maliciously about 
us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to 
welcome the brothers. He also stops 
those who want to do so and puts them 
out of the church. 

"Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil 
but what is good. Anyone who does 
what is good is from God. Anyone who 
does what is evil has not seen God. 

12 Demetrius is well spoken of by 
everyone-and even by the truth itself. 
We also speak well of him, and you 
know that our testimony is true. 

13 l have much to write you, but I do not 
want to do so with pen and ink. 

14 l hope to see you soon, and we will 
talk face to face. Peace to you. The 
friends here send their greetings. Greet 
the friends there by name. 



Jude 



1 



Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a 

brother of James, To those who have 
been called, who are loved by God the 
Father and kept by Jesus Christ: 

2 Mercy, peace and love be yours in 
abundance. 



Dear friends, although I was very eager 
to write to you about the salvation we 
share, I felt I had to write and urge you 
to contend for the faith that was once for 
all entrusted to the saints. 

4 For certain men whose condemnation 
was written about long ago have 
secretly slipped in among you. They are 
godless men, who change the grace of 
our God into a license for immorality and 
deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign 
and Lord. 

5 Though you already know all this, I 
want to remind you that the Lord 
delivered his people out of Egypt, but 
later destroyed those who did not 
believe. 

6 And the angels who did not keep their 
positions of authority but abandoned 
their own home-these he has kept in 
darkness, bound with everlasting chains 
for judgment on the great Day. 

7 ln a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah 
and the surrounding towns gave 
themselves up to sexual immorality and 
perversion. They serve as an example 



of those who suffer the punishment of 
eternal fire. 

8 ln the very same way, these dreamers 
pollute their own bodies, reject authority 
and slander celestial beings. 

9 But even the archangel Michael, when 
he was disputing with the devil about the 
body of Moses, did not dare to bring a 
slanderous accusation against him, but 
said, "The Lord rebuke you!" 

10 Yet these men speak abusively 
against whatever they do not 
understand; and what things they do 
understand by instinct, like unreasoning 
animals-these are the very things that 
destroy them. 

11 Woe to them! They have taken the 
way of Cain; they have rushed for profit 
into Balaam's error; they have been 
destroyed in Korah's rebellion. 

12 These men are blemishes at your love 
feasts, eating with you without the 
slightest qualm-shepherds who feed 
only themselves. They are clouds 
without rain, blown along by the wind; 
autumn trees, without fruit and 
uprooted-twice dead. 

13 They are wild waves of the sea, 
foaming up their shame; wandering 
stars, for whom blackest darkness has 
been reserved forever. 

14 Enoch, the seventh from Adam, 
prophesied about these men: "See, the 



Lord is coming with thousands upon 
thousands of his holy ones 

15 to judge everyone, and to convict all 
the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they 
have done in the ungodly way, and of all 
the harsh words ungodly sinners have 
spoken against him." 

16 These men are grumblers and 
faultfinders; they follow their own evil 
desires; they boast about themselves 
and flatter others for their own 
advantage. 

17 But, dear friends, remember what the 
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ 
foretold. 

18 They said to you, "In the last times 
there will be scoffers who will follow their 
own ungodly desires." 

19 These are the men who divide you, 
who follow mere natural instincts and do 
not have the Spirit. 



But you, dear friends, build yourselves 
up in your most holy faith and pray in 
the Holy Spirit. 

21 Keep yourselves in God's love as you 
wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus 
Christ to bring you to eternal life. 

22 Be merciful to those who doubt; 

23 snatch others from the fire and save 
them; to others show mercy, mixed with 
fear-hating even the clothing stained by 
corrupted flesh. 

24 To him who is able to keep you from 
falling and to present you before his 
glorious presence without fault and with 
great joy- 

25 to the only God our Savior be glory, 
majesty, power and authority, through 
Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, 
now and forevermore! Amen.
